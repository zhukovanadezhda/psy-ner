Most likely this model has never seen anything like this abstract before. Moreover, as we can see below, our model doesn't even posess the labels that we want.

       "<span class=\"tex2jax_ignore\"><div class=\"entities\" style=\"line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr\">The PAWS Study used an online platform to deliver a cross-sectional survey instrument designed to assess participants' retrospective perspectives on the mental health effects of classic psychedelic use, as well as predictors of positive and negative outcomes from this use. Because of our focus on classic psychedelic agents (i.e., tryptamines and phenethylamines with a primary mechanism of action believed to be agonism of the serotonin 5HT2A receptor), we did not query 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which has a different mechanism of action and tends to produce different acute effects than classic psychedelics. Given the widespread emerging use of ketamine as a ‚Äúpsychedelic-like‚Äù agent for the treatment of major depressive disorder, we included this agent in our survey, although we recognize that it is not a classic psychedelic.</div></span>"
