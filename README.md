Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and extracting named entities from unstructured text data. Named entities are specific types of objects, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other types of things that can be named.

The goal of NER is to accurately identify and classify named entities in text data, which can be useful for a variety of applications, such as information retrieval, text summarization, machine translation, and more. NER involves developing algorithms and models that can automatically recognize and categorize named entities in text data, and it can be a challenging task because named entities can be expressed in many different ways and can have complex relationships with other entities and the surrounding text.
