        "In 2020, Oregon voters legalized therapeutic psilocybin in response to a plethora of scientific studies showing symptom reduction for depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, opioid addictions, migraines, other mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and cancer. The legal rethinking regarding therapeutic psilocybin continues in both state legislatures and city councils. Yet, despite state and local legalization or decriminalization of therapeutic psilocybin it remains illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act. This tension between local and federal law places therapeutic psilocybin users and their employers in a difficult position. Because all types of psilocybin use remain illegal under federal law, a zero-tolerance drug use workplace policy would discipline a state sanctioned psilocybin user for off-site or off-hours therapeutic psilocybin use. Therefore, this article proposes that as states and cities legalize therapeutic psilocybin, jurisdictions should adopt employment protections for therapeutic psilocybin users like states have adopted for medical cannabis users. The proposed statute in this article protects therapeutic psilocybin users from adverse action based solely on off-site and off-hours drug use and balances employers' rights.",

        "Patients with 'visual snow' report continuous tiny dots in the entire visual field similar to the noise of an analogue television. As they frequently have migraine as a comorbidity with ophthalmological, neurological and radiological studies being normal, they are offered various diagnoses, including persistent migraine aura, post-hallucinogen flashback, or psychogenic disorder. Our aim was to study patients with 'visual snow' to characterize the phenotype. A three-step approach was followed: (i) a chart review of patients referred to us identified 22 patients with 'visual snow'. Fifteen had additional visual symptoms, and 20 patients had comorbid migraine, five with aura; (ii) to identify systematically additional visual symptoms, an internet survey (n = 275) of self-assessed 'visual snow' subjects done by Eye On Vision Foundation was analysed. In two random samples from 235 complete data sets, the same eight additional visual symptoms were present in >33% of patients: palinopsia (trailing and afterimages), entoptic phenomena (floaters, blue field entoptic phenomenon, spontaneous photopsia, self-light of the eye), photophobia, and nyctalopia (impaired night vision); and (iii) a prospective semi-structured telephone interview in a further 142 patients identified 78 (41 female) with confirmed 'visual snow' and normal ophthalmological exams. Of these, 72 had at least three of the additional visual symptoms from step (ii). One-quarter of patients had 'visual snow' as long as they could remember, whereas for the others the mean age of onset was 21 +- 9 years. Thirty-two patients had constant visual symptoms, whereas the remainder experienced either progressive or stepwise worsening. Headache was the most frequent symptom associated with the beginning or a worsening of the visual disturbance (36%), whereas migraine aura (seven patients) and consumption of illicit drugs (five, no hallucinogens) were rare. Migraine (59%), migraine with aura (27%), anxiety and depression were common comorbidities over time. Eight patients had first degree relatives with visual snow. Clinical investigations were not contributory. Only a few treatment trials have been successful in individual patients. Our data suggest that 'visual snow' is a unique visual disturbance clinically distinct from migraine aura that can be disabling for patients. Migraine is a common concomitant although standard migraine treatments are often unhelpful. 'Visual snow' should be considered a distinct disorder and systematic studies of its clinical features, biology and treatment responses need to be commenced to begin to understand what has been an almost completely ignored problem.",

        "This article presents a qualitative interview study of people who microdose with psychedelic drugs, which means that the user takes about one tenth of an ordinary recreational dose. Respondents ( = 21) were recruited at several Internet fora for individual interviews via private messaging. Every participant was male, and the median respondent was in his 30s with a stable job and relationship and extensive entheogen experience. Respondents tended to experiment with microdosing in phases, reporting mostly positive consequences from this form of drug use. Reported effects included improved mood, cognition, and creativity, which often served to counteract symptoms especially from conditions of anxiety and depression. There were also reports of various challenges with psychedelic microdosing, and some did not find the practice worth continuing. The study obtained evidence of a group of users taking small doses of psychedelics not for the purpose of intoxication but to enhance everyday functioning. While the study's findings are not generalisable, they may inform subsequent investigations with research questions and hypotheses. ",

        "Cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs) are prescribed with increased frequency, despite a paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials. The aim of this study is to analyze the early outcomes of the first series of patients prescribed CBMPs in the UK with respect to effects on health-related quality of life and clinical safety. A prospective case series was performed using the UK Medical Cannabis Registry. Primary outcomes were change in patient-reported outcomes measures (EQ-5D-5L, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Single-Item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS)) at 1 and 3 months from baseline. The secondary outcome was the incidence of adverse events. Statistical significance was defined by a P-value <.050. There were 129 patients included in the final analysis with a mean age of 46.23 (+-14.51) years. The most common indication was chronic pain of undefined etiology (n = 48; 37.2%). The median initial cannabidiol and (-)-trans-D9-tetrahydrocannabinol daily dose was 20.0 mg (Range: 0.0-768.0 mg) and 3.9 mg (Range: 0.0-660.0 mg), respectively. Statistically significant improvements in health-related quality of life were demonstrated at 1 and 3 months in GAD-7, SQS, EQ-5D-5L pain and discomfort subscale, EQ-5D-5L anxiety and depression subscale, EQ-VAS and EQ-5D-5L index values(P < .050). There were 31 (24.03%) total reported adverse events. This study suggests that CBMP therapy may be associated with an improvement in health-related quality-of-life outcomes as self-reported by patients. CBMPs are also demonstrated to be relatively safe in the short to medium-term. These findings must be treated with caution given the limited scope of this initial analysis, with no placebo or an active comparator, with further research required. ",

        "Psychedelic 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonists are showing promise in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as treatment-resistant depression and anxiety. Human studies suggest that enhanced cognitive flexibility may contribute to their clinical efficacy. Both improvement and impairment of cognitive flexibility has been reported with 5-HT2AR ligands, making the link between 5-HT2AR pharmacology and cognitive flexibility equivocal. We tested the selective 5-HT2AR agonist 25CN-NBOH in healthy male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice in a touchscreen-based mouse reversal learning test. No effects were observed on acquisition of the new stimulus-reward contingency, learning errors, or perseverative responses during reversal. Our results suggest that 25CN-NBOH does not affect reversal learning in the schedule used in this study.",

        "Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, anhedonia, flat affect and cognitive impairments. The aim of this study was to propose a prenatal treatment with ketamine, a psychedelic drug that acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of glutamate NMDA receptors, as a neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia. The drug was applied (i.m. 60 mg.kg  h ) in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats on gestational Day 14. Offspring behavior was studied on pubertal (4 weeks old) and adult (10 weeks old) stages. Also, hippocampal CA1-CA3 morphology was assessed in adult animals through a Nissl stain. Results showed a disinhibition and hyperactive behavior in pubertal animals exposed to ketamine, followed in adulthood with cognitive impairments, social withdrawal, anxiety, depression, and aggressive-like behaviors. In the hippocampus, a reduction of the CA3 layer thickness was observed, without changes in cell density. These results strongly suggest a robust link between prenatal pharmacologic manipulation of NMDA receptors and schizophrenia. ",

        "Few and often contradictory reports exist on the long-term neurobiological consequences of cannabinoid consumption in adolescents. The endocannabinoid system plays an important role during the different stages of brain development as cannabinoids influence the release and action of different neurotransmitters and promote neurogenesis. This study tested whether long-lasting interference by cannabinoids with the developing endogenous cannabinoid system during adolescence caused persistent behavioral alterations in adult rats. Adolescent female and male rats were treated with increasing doses of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for 11 days (postnatal day (PND) 35-45) and left undisturbed until adulthood (PND 75) when behavioral and biochemical assays were carried out. CB1 receptor level and CB1/G-protein coupling were significantly reduced by THC exposure in the amygdala (Amyg), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of female rats, whereas male rats had significant alterations only in the amygdala and hippocampal formation. Neither female nor male rats showed any changes in anxiety responses (elevated plus maze and open-field tests) but female rats presented significant 'behavioral despair' (forced swim test) paralleled by anhedonia (sucrose preference). In contrast, male rats showed no behavioral despair but did present anhedonia. This different behavioral picture was supported by biochemical parameters of depression, namely CREB alteration. Only female rats had low CREB activity in the hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex and high activity in the NAc paralleled by increases in dynorphin expression. These results suggest that heavy cannabis consumption in adolescence may induce subtle alterations in the emotional circuit in female rats, ending in depressive-like behavior, whereas male rats show altered sensitivity to rewarding stimuli.",

        "Brominated indole alkaloids are a common class of metabolites reported from sponges of the order Verongida. Herein we report the isolation, structure determination, and activity of metabolites from three Florida sponges, namely, Verongula rigida (order Verongida, family Aplysinidae), Smenospongia aurea, and S. cerebriformis (order Dictyoceratida, family Thorectidae). All three species were investigated chemically, revealing similarities in secondary metabolites. Brominated compounds, as well as sesquiterpene quinones and hydroquinones, were identified from both V. rigida and S. aurea despite their apparent taxonomic differences at the ordinal level. Similar metabolites found in these distinct sponge species of two different genera provide evidence for a microbial origin of the metabolites. Isolated compounds were evaluated in the Porsolt forced swim test (FST) and the chick anxiety-depression continuum model. Among the isolated compounds, 5,6-dibromo- N,N-dimethyltryptamine ( 1) exhibited significant antidepressant-like action in the rodent FST model, while 5-bromo- N,N-dimethyltryptamine ( 2) caused significant reduction of locomotor activity indicative of a potential sedative action. The current study provides ample evidence that marine natural products with the diversity of brominated marine alkaloids will provide potential leads for antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs.",

        "Ayahuasca is a psychotropic drink made from the Amazonian vine Banisteriopsis caapi. Active components include beta-carboline alkaloids and the hallucinogen N-N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). This review aimed to identify and summarize the literature on the safety and effectiveness of ayahuasca among recreational users. A comprehensive literature search was done on November 1, 2019 in the following six databases: PubMed(MEDLINE), Ovid Embase, Ovid International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science. Articles were included if they were original research published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese, among human participants using oral ayahuasca for neuropsychiatric effects. Chemical or pharmacological analyses, brain imaging studies, and studies examining the use of ayahuasca within a religious context were excluded. 5750 unique titles were identified through the database searches, with an additional 19 titles identified through manual searches. Ultimately, 39 met all the criteria for inclusion. Articles were organized into 4 themes: (1) Case reports and case series; (2) The use of ayahuasca for depression or grief; (3) The use of ayahuasca and other psychiatric or neuropsychological outcomes; and (4) Studies examining ayahuasca use and physiologic outcomes. Ayahuasca use is associated with a risk of both psychiatric and non-psychiatric events including hallucinations, agitation or aggression, vomiting, seizure, and rhabdomyolysis. Five fatalities have been reported in the literature following ayahuasca use. Open-label studies assessing ayahuasca use in depression found favorable results persisting across 21 days. Ayahuasca was also found to influence the MINDSENS scale for mindfulness, with mixed results observed for impact of ayahuasca on cognitive function and creativity, and benefits observed for measures of self-acceptance and overall wellbeing. To date, evidence on benefits for the management of depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders is mixed, with some evidence suggesting improvements in mindfulness measures and creativity that are generally short-lived, and multiple case reports suggesting the potential for harm and interactions.

        "Childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is found to be a risk factor for substance use in adolescence, but literature has suggested that the observed influence of ADHD may be driven by the comorbid conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiance disorder (ODD). We examine whether childhood ADHD and CD influence lifetime use of substances, independent of other comorbid mental problems and familial risk factors. A total of 712 sibling pairs from a nationally representative US longitudinal survey were followed from 1997 to 2015. The Behavior Problems Index (BPI) was used to measure mental disorders in children. The hyperactive, antisocial, headstrong, anxious/depressed subscales of the BPI for ADHD, CD, ODD, anxiety/depression of children were assessed by their biological mothers who were the primary caregiver. Lifetime substance use by age 18 was measured by self-reports. A within-family design was used to minimize confounding. After controlling for mother fixed effects and comorbid mental disorders, symptoms of ADHD were not associated with lifetime substance use in adolescence except for regular smoking, while those of CD were positively and significantly associated with heightened risk for lifetime use of cannabis, regular smoking, cocaine, barbiturates, tranquilizers, hallucinogens, and inhalants in adolescence. The results suggest that the association observed between childhood ADHD and substance use in adolescence may be driven by comorbid CD whose influences are robust to other mental disorders or unobserved familial factors.

        "Human research with psychedelics is making groundbreaking discoveries. Psychedelics modify enduring elements of personality and seemingly reduce anxiety, depression, and substance dependence in small but well-designed clinical studies. Psychedelics are advancing through pharmaceutical regulatory systems, and neuroimaging studies have related their extraordinary effects to select brain networks. This field is making significant basic science and translational discoveries, yet preclinical studies have lagged this renaissance in human psychedelic research. Preclinical studies have a lot to offer psychedelic research as they afford tight control of experimental parameters, subjects with documented drug histories, and the capacity to elucidate relevant signaling cascades as well as conduct invasive mechanistic studies of neurochemistry and neural circuits. Safety pharmacology, novel biomarkers, and pharmacokinetics can be assessed in disease state models to advance psychedelics toward clinical practice. This chapter documents the current status of psychedelic research, with the thematic argument that new preclinical studies would benefit this field.",

        "Classic psychedelics, including psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), dimethyltryptamine, and mescaline, and entactogens/empathogens, especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, have received renewed attention in psychiatric research and may be developed into medications for such indications as anxiety, depression, cluster headache, and posttraumatic stress disorder, among others. However, identifying proper doses is crucial. Controlled study data on dosing using well-characterized pharmaceutical formulations of the substances are scarce. The dose equivalence of different substances, dose-response effects, and subjective effects of different doses are of great interest and practically important for their clinical use in psychotherapy. Furthermore, the so-called microdosing of psychedelics has recently gained popularity, and the first placebo-controlled studies of LSD have been published. This chapter discusses different aspects of psychedelic dosing, including pharmaceutical aspects, definitions and characteristics of different doses, including microdoses, aspects of personalized dosing, and non-pharmacological factors, that can influence the response to psychedelics.",

        "To assess the role of psychedelics in the treatment of anxiety or depression among patients with cancer. PubMed search from inception to March 11, 2022, using the terms anxiety, depression, psychedelics, psilocybin, lysergic acid, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or ayahuasca. Studies assessing patients with cancer receiving psychedelics for the treatment of anxiety or depression. Five unique randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted. Significant reductions were found in 2 trials with 2 anxiety scales (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait) and in 1 trial with 2 additional anxiety scales (Hamilton Rating Scale-Anxiety, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety). Significant reductions were found in 2 trials in 2 depression scales (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression, Beck Depression Inventory) and in 1 trial with an additional depression scale (Hamilton Rating Scale-Depression). Two studies assessed for clinically relevant reductions in anxiety and depression scores, and they occurred much more commonly in psychedelic-treated patients than those given placebo. There is a new potential option for treating patients with anxiety and depression along with cancer, which is important given the generally lackluster benefits with traditional antidepressants. Only a few sessions may also provide benefits extending out for 6 to 12 months and possibly beyond that. However, the studies were small, had many methodological limitations, and there were increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Psychedelics have a unique mechanism of action that might be well suited for treating anxiety and depression associated with cancer. This offers new promise for patients who are not being sufficiently treated with current antianxiety or antidepressant medications. ",

        "Synthetic Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists (SCRAs) are the largest group of new psychoactive substances reported to the European Warning System and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to date. The heterogeneous nature and speed of diversification of these compounds make it challenging to accurately characterise and predict harms of these compounds in pre-clinical studies, ahead of their appearance. We report the case of a 19-year-old female who purchased three products from a headshop: two new psychoactive substances (sachets of \"cannabis tea\" and \"mushroom tea\") as well as two LSD blotters. After the \"cannabis tea\" was smoked and the two LSD blotters and \"mushroom tea\" were ingested, the patient became tachycardic (HR 128), developed seizures, agitation, visual hallucinations as well as suspected serotonergic toxicity (sustained ankle clonus 20-30 beats) 1-2 hours after use. She was treated with 1 mg of intravenous midazolam. Symptoms/signs resolved within 13 hours. No further supportive care was required. Plasma, blood, and urine samples confirmed the presence of two SCRAs: 5FAKB-48 and 5F-PB-22. The patient also reported therapeutic use of both fluoxetine and citalopram for depression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of non-fatal intoxication with 5F-AKB-48 with analytical confirmation and exposure times. It also highlights the difficulties in understanding the pattern of toxicity of certain SCRAs in the context of psychotropic medications/co-morbid mental illness. ",

        "Naturalistic and placebo-controlled studies suggest ayahuasca, a potent psychedelic beverage originating from Indigenous Amazonian tradition, may improve mental health, alter personality structure, and reduce alcohol and drug intake. To better understand ayahuasca's therapeutic potential and to identify factors that influence therapeutic efficacy, we conducted a naturalistic, longitudinal study of facilitated ayahuasca consumption in naive participants using a comprehensive battery of self-report questionnaires.  Ayahuasca naive individuals registering for ayahuasca ceremonies were asked to complete a range of validated questionnaires assessing mental health, alcohol/cannabis use, relationships, personality, and connection to self and spirituality, prior to and 1 month after attending an ayahuasca ceremony. Data for two mental health measures (the DASS-21 and PANAS) and acute subjective effects  the MEQ-30 were also assessed 7 days post-ceremony. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to examine pre-to-post changes, and Pearson correlations explored predictors of improvement in outcomes.  Fifty-three attendees (32 women, 21 men) completed pre and post ayahuasca assessments with 55.6% of the sample reporting a complete mystical experience based on the MEQ-30. One-month post-ayahuasca, significant reductions were identified in depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol and cannabis use, body dissociation, accepting external influence, self-alienation, impulsivity, and negative affect/emotionality. Significant increases were identified in positive mood, self-efficacy, authentic living, extraversion, agreeableness, open-mindedness, spirituality, and satisfaction with relationships. While facets of the mystical experience held little predictive validity on outcome measures, baseline traits, particularly high negative emotionality and body dissociation, and low sense of self-efficacy, robustly predicted improvements in mental health and alcohol/cannabis use, and alterations in personality structure which are linked to better mental health.  This study suggests facilitated ayahuasca consumption in naive participants may precipitate wide-ranging improvements in mental health, relationships, personality structure, and alcohol use. Associations between baseline traits and therapeutic improvements mark an important first step toward personalized, precision-based medicine and warrant randomized controlled trials to confirm and elaborate on these findings.  Longitudinal, observational studies and randomized clinical control trials suggest ayahuasca may exert therapeutic effects on mental health and alcohol/cannabis use, and alter personality structure. However, it is unclear if improvements are diagnosis-specific and factors that predict therapeutic gains have yet to be extensively elucidated. This longitudinal, observational study examined the effects of facilitated ayahuasca consumption in naive participants on mental health, alcohol and substance use/abuse, personality traits, relationships, and connection to self and spirituality. We found wide-ranging improvements 1-month post-treatment across these domains, and identified baseline traits which predict pre-to-post changes on primary outcome measures. Improvements were not diagnostic-specific, suggesting ayahuasca may be generally efficacious. Personality traits, body dissociation, and self-efficacy were strong predictors of therapeutic improvements, marking an important first step toward personalized, precision-based medicine. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm and elaborate on these findings. ",

        "The aim of the present study is to test a hypothesis that 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in the amygdala play an important role in the regulation of anxiety behaviors. We examined alterations in anxiety-like behaviors after manipulation of the expression of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in the amygdala using recombinant adenovirus approaches. Recombinant adenoviruses containing a 5-HT(1A) promoter-controlled 5-HT(1A) antisense sequence or a 5-HT(2C) promoter-controlled 5-HT(2C) sense sequence were injected into the amygdala. Elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open field tests were conducted to determine anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity. Reductions in the expression of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the amygdala significantly attenuated the time spent in the open arms of EPM and time spent in the center of an open field. Reduction in the percent of time spent in the open arms of EPM is negatively correlated with the density of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the central amygdala. On the other hand, increased expression of 5-HT(2C) receptors reduced the time spent in the open arms of EPM and time spent in the center of an open field. The reductions in the time spent and distance traveled in the open arms of EPM were correlated to the density of 5-HT(2C) receptors in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala. These data suggest that amygdaloid 5-HT(1A) receptors produce anxiolytic and 5-HT(2C) receptors produce anxiogenic effects. Together, the present results demonstrate the important role of the amygdaloid 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in the regulation of anxiety-like behaviors.

        "PDE1B is a calcium-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase that is highly expressed in the striatum. In order to investigate the physiological role of PDE1B in the central nervous system, PDE1B knockout mice (C57BL/6N background) were assessed in behavioral tests and their brains were assayed for monoamine content. In a variety of well-characterized behavioral tasks, including the elevated plus maze (anxiety-like behavior), forced swim test (depression-like behavior), hot plate (nociception) and two cognition models (passive avoidance and acquisition of conditioned avoidance responding), PDE1B knockout mice performed similarly to wild-type mice. PDE1B knockout mice showed increased baseline exploratory activity when compared to wild-type mice. When challenged with amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (METH), male and female PDE1B knockout mice showed an exaggerated locomotor response. Male PDE1B knockout mice also showed increased locomotor responses to higher doses of phencyclidine (PCP) and MK-801; however, this effect was not consistently observed in female knockout mice. In the striatum, increased dopamine turnover (DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA ratios) was found in both male and female PDE1B knockout mice. Striatal serotonin (5-HT) levels were also decreased in PDE1B knockout mice, although levels of the metabolite, 5HIAA, were unchanged. The present studies demonstrate increased striatal dopamine turnover in PDE1B knockout mice associated with increased baseline motor activity and an exaggerated locomotor response to dopaminergic stimulants such as methamphetamine and amphetamine. These data further support a role for PDE1B in striatal function.",

        "Adolescent and young adults are at increased risk of psychiatric distress and serious disability. We estimated the prevalence and associated risk factors of psychiatric distress among the college students of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. We performed this cross-sectional study, from Jan to May 2016 at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran. Students filled out voluntarily an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, personal information, behavioral risk factors, and a validated Persian version of the GHQ-28 questionnaire, including somatic symptoms (items 1-7), anxiety/insomnia (items 8-14), social dysfunctions (items 15-21), and severe depression (items 22-28). Of 1259 participants, 518 (41.1%) had psychiatric distress, 166 (13.2%) had heterosexual intercourse, 100 (8.0%) had homosexual intercourse, 204 (16.2%) were smokers (31.6% in males and 6.3% in females), 124 (9.9%) reported a history of using opium/psychedelic substances, 204 (16.2%) reported suicide thought, and 103 (8.2%) had attempted suicide at least once in the past. After adjusting odds ratio (95% CI) for age and sex, psychiatric distress were significantly associated with emotional breakdown 2.67 (2.09, 3.40), heterosexual intercourse 2.56 (1.82, 3.62), homosexual intercourse 2.42 (1.57, 3.71), smoking 3.19 (2.29, 4.45), substance abuse 5.03 (3.26, 7.76), suicide thought 7.81 (5.42, 11.27), suicide attempt 5.64 (3.49, 9.12), uninterested in the discipline 2.29 (1.70, 3.07), and non-optimistic about future 2.16 (1.63, 2.86). A majority of college students had psychiatric distress and a substantial number of them reported one or more high-risk behaviors that if neglected, may severely impair the students' function and influence their subsequent development and productive lives.

        "Sharing space with a fashion fair, the American Psychiatric Association's Annual Meeting took place at the Javits Center on the West side of Manhattan where psychiatrists and psychiatry-focused neuroscientists met to discuss the latest advances in antipsychotic, antidepressant and related therapies. Mixing psychiatry with fashion was a psychedelic experience, but the meeting was too busy to give more than a passing glimpse to screens showing the newest trends in fashion. Revival of old styles? That in a sense also happened in psychiatry, with experts defending the current place of lithium in therapeutics. Newest, youngest look? That was also true for psychiatry, with new investigational therapeutics challenging the place of older treatment approaches because of improved efficacy, better safety and tolerability, or easier administration. What about these patchwork trends? This again was met in psychiatry, with combination therapies aimed at a more comprehensive control of underlying processes in diseases such as schizophrenia. And these nice complements, or a few highlights? Psychiatric therapies also include augmentation strategies, which were discussed during this year's meeting along with examples of the previously mentioned approaches that are included in the following report.",

        "The long-term behavioural and neurotoxic effects of 3,4-methlyenedioxymethampthetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\") were examined in rats. Rats were given MDMA (5 mg/kg i.p. once per hour for 4 h) or vehicle injections on each of two consecutive days at an ambient temparature of 28 degrees C. MDMA caused acute hyperthermia and locomotor hyperactivity on both days. Four and six weeks after drug administration the rats previously treated with MDMA showed elevated levels of anxiety-like behaviour in the emergence and social interaction tests, respectively. At 9 weeks post-MDMA, the rats displayed an increase in anxiety on the elevated plus-maze test relative to controls. Ten weeks following treatment the rats were killed and their brains dissected and neurotramitter content analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromotography (HPLC). Rats previously given MDMA showed significantly decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the amygdala, hippocampus and striatum relative to controls. This 5-HT depletion may have a causal role in producing increased anxiety-like behaviours in MDMA-treated rats. These results are consistent with human studies suggesting that exposure to high doses of MDMA may predispose to long-term psychological problems such as anxiety and depression.",

        "Trait impulsivity has been linked to addiction in humans. It has been suggested that drug users with high trait impulsivity levels are more sensitive to subjective drug intoxication. This study assessed whether subjective response to drugs differs between drug users with normal or high levels of trait impulsivity. Regular drug users (N = 122) received doses of cocaine HCl, cannabis, and placebo in a three-way crossover study. Their mood, dissociative state, and psychedelic symptoms were measured with subjective rating scales (CADDS, Bowdle, POMS). Trait impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Cannabis increased dissociation and psychedelic state, as well as fatigue, confusion, depression and anxiety, and decreased arousal, positive mood, vigor, friendliness, and elation. Cocaine increased dissociation, psychedelic state, vigor, friendliness, elation, positive mood, anxiety and arousal, while decreasing fatigue. Only a few subjective items revealed a drug x trait impulsivity interaction, suggesting that psychedelic symptoms were most intense in high impulsivity subjects. Trait impulsiveness ratings were negatively correlated with ratings of vigor (r = -.197) and positively correlated with ratings of loss of thought control (r = .237) during cannabis intoxication.

        "Serotonin 2A receptor (5-HTR) agonist \"classic psychedelics\" are drawing increasing interest as potential mental health treatments. Recent work suggests psychedelics can exert persisting anxiolytic and antidepressant effects lasting up to several months after a single administration. Data indicate acute subjective drug effects as important psychological factors involved in observed therapeutic benefits. Additionally, animal models have shown an important role for 5-HTR agonists in modulating learning and memory function with relevance for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias. A number of biological mechanisms of action are under investigation to elucidate 5-HTR agonists' therapeutic potential, including enhanced neuroplasticity, anti-inflammatory effects, and alterations in brain functional connectivity. These diverse lines of research are reviewed here along with a discussion of AD pathophysiology and neuropsychiatric symptoms to highlight classic psychedelics as potential novel pharmacotherapies for patients with AD. Human clinical research suggests a possible role for high-dose psychedelic administration in symptomatic treatment of depressed mood and anxiety in early-stage AD. Preclinical data indicate a potential for low- or high-dose psychedelic treatment regimens to slow or reverse brain atrophy, enhance cognitive function, and slow progression of AD. In conclusion, rationale and potential approaches for preliminary research with psychedelics in patients with AD are presented, and ramifications of this line of investigation for development of novel AD treatments are discussed.

        "Abolishment of anxiolytic-like effects of diazepam occurs during re-exposure to some animal tests of anxiety. We investigated the loss of anxiolytic-like effects of diazepam during Trial 2 on previously undrugged mice, namely one-trial tolerance (OTT). Swiss mice were subjected to 1) Four-Plate Test (FPT) without punishments in Trial 1 or 2) FPT without punishments in both Trials or 3) FPT with spatial modifications in Trial 1 or 4) Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), then 24 h later to FPT, with saline, diazepam (1 mg/kg) or DOI (1 mg/kg). Removing punishments in Trial 1 does not counteract the effect reduction of diazepam in Trial 2, but spatial modifications of the aversive environment. Previous exposure to EPM does not trigger a loss of efficacy of diazepam in FPT. Electric punishments do not trigger OTT to benzodiazepines; whilst knowledge of the environment seems to be responsible for this phenomenon. FPT may be useful to study OTT because punishments potentate OTT in this model of anxiety.",

        "The regular consumption of very small doses of psychedelic drugs (known as microdosing) has been a source of growing media and community attention in recent years. However, there is currently limited clinical and social research evidence on the potential role of microdosing as therapies for mental and substance use disorders. This paper examined subjective experiences of microdosing psychedelics to improve mental health or to cease or reduce substance use, and examined sociodemographic and other covariates of perceived improvements in mental health that individuals attributed to microdosing. An international online survey was conducted in 2018 and examined people's experiences of using psychedelics for self-reported therapeutic or enhancement purposes. This paper focuses on 1102 respondents who reported current or past experience of psychedelic microdosing. Twenty-one percent of respondents reported primarily microdosing as a therapy for depression, 7% for anxiety, 9% for other mental disorders and 2% for substance use cessation or reduction. Forty-four percent of respondents perceived that their mental health was \"much better\" as a consequence of microdosing. In a multivariate analysis, perceived improvements in mental health from microdosing were associated with a range of variables including gender, education, microdosing duration and motivations, and recent use of larger psychedelic doses. Given the promising findings of clinical trials of standard psychedelic doses as mental health therapies, clinical microdosing research is needed to determine its potential role in psychiatric treatment, and ongoing social research to better understand the use of microdosing as self-managed mental health and substance use therapies.

        "Although an association has been found recently between obsessive-compulsive disorder and an increased risk of suicide, the prevalence of both suicidal ideation and attempts vary considerably and are generally assessed categorically. Our aims were to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviors using a dimensional approach. The sample included 129 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Suicidality was assessed by administering the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Logistic and linear regressions were used to examine predictors of suicidal ideation, severe suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviors were 64.3% and 16.3%, respectively. Lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with the number of stressful life events, duration of illness, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores, and family history of mood disorders. A family history of obsessive-compulsive disorder was associated with a lower probability of lifetime suicidal ideation. Severe suicidal ideation was related to greater severity of the most stressful life event, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores, and longer duration of untreated illness. The probability of lifetime suicidal behavior was related to Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores, symmetry obsessions, and washing and checking compulsions. The probability of lifetime non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors was related to Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores. Recognizing predictors of suicidal ideation/behavior is crucial to identifying patients at greater risk. ",

        "Behavioral effects of the phenethylamine derivative (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenyl)-2-aminopropane (ALEPH-2) were studied in mice and rats. Murine locomotor activity, measured with a photocell actometer, was markedly depressed following IP injection of 2 and 6 mg/kg of the drug. The same doses of the drug also decreased frequency and duration of head dipping and the number of rearings in the hole board apparatus. In the murine elevated plus maze 2 and 6 mg/kg of ALEPH-2 increased the percentage of both open arm entries and time. The total number of entries into the enclosed arms was not significantly affected by the drug. In the rat, 2-12 mg/kg ALEPH-2, IP, decreased photobeam counts in the actometer in a dose-dependent fashion. Both 2 and 4 mg/kg of the drug increased the percentage of open arm entries, but only the highest dose significantly increased the percentage of time spent on the open arms. The dose of 4 mg/kg ALEPH-2 also significantly decreased the total number of enclosed arm entries. Finally, in a recently developed model of anxiety and memory, the elevated T-maze, the doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg ALEPH-2 did not change inhibitory avoidance of the open arms. Nevertheless, the highest dose had an amnestic effect on this task, repeated 72 h later in the absence of drug. In addition, this dose significantly increased the latency to escape from the open arms and had an amnestic effect measured 72 h later. Overall, these results indicate that ALEPH-2 possesses anxiolytic, amnestic as well as sedative and/or motor depressant actions.",

        "Existing pharmacological treatments for psychiatric disorders have demonstrated limited efficacy, delayed onset of action, and significant burden of side effects. Recent findings from human studies with psychedelics have shown promise, demonstrating rapid and sustained clinical benefits of these compounds for a variety of psychiatric disorders. Classical psychedelics have a rich history and some of these compounds have been used in shamanic and spiritual ceremonies for millennia. The psychoactive effects of these drugs, particularly on human consciousness, have generated great scientific curiosity, and early research on psychedelics suggested their clinical benefits for psychiatric conditions, including alcohol use disorders and anxiety and depressive symptoms in terminal illness and life-threatening conditions. Since the 1990s, after a period of dormancy that followed the criminalization of psychedelic drugs since the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, the continued interest in their unique psychoactive effects along with the pursuit for novel and more effective treatments in psychiatry have led to a renewed interest in research on these compounds. While preliminary findings on psychedelics are encouraging, current evidence is still insufficient to support extensive use of these drugs routinely. Long-term safety and efficacy of these compounds remain unclear, and several clinical trials are underway and may add clarity to these questions. Therefore, this article intends to provide an overview of the evidence to date on psychedelic drugs - particularly psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD - for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.",

        "The acute activation of kappa opioid receptors (KOPr) produces antinociceptive and anti-cocaine effects, however, their side-effects have limited further clinical development. Mesyl Sal B is a potent and selective KOPr analogue of Salvinorin A (Sal A), a psychoactive natural product isolated from the plant . We assessed the antinociceptive, anti-cocaine, and side-effects of Mesyl Sal B. The anti-cocaine effects are evaluated in cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine in male Sprague Dawley rats. Mesyl Sal B was assessed for anhedonia (conditioned taste aversion), aversion (conditioned place aversion), pro-depressive effects (forced swim test), anxiety (elevated plus maze) and learning and memory deficits (novel object recognition). In male B6.SJL mice, the antinociceptive effects were evaluated in warm-water (50 degC) tail withdrawal and intraplantar formaldehyde (2%) assays and the sedative effects measured with the rotarod performance task. Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine without modulating sucrose self-administration and without producing aversion, sedation, anxiety, or learning and memory impairment in rats. However, increased immobility was observed in the forced swim test indicating pro-depressive effects. Mesyl Sal B was not as potent as Sal A at reducing pain in the antinociceptive assays. In conclusion, Mesyl Sal B possesses anti-cocaine effects, is longer acting in vivo and has fewer side-effects when compared to Sal A, however, the antinociceptive effects are limited. ",

        "This study examines panic attacks and substance use in a sample of incoming college freshman (n = 399 ) using questionnaires. Panickers (n = 47 ) were significantly more likely than nonpanickers (n = 290) to report having ever used sedatives, stimulants, opiods, and other drugs, but not tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, or hallucinogens. Gender and race did not substantially moderate the associations between substance use and panic attacks. Sedative, stimulant, opiod, and other drug use was not associated with panic attack frequency or the occurrence of unexpected attacks. The relationships of anxiety and depression with substance use were larger for panickers than nonpanickers. These results are consistent with the idea that self-medication and symptom exacerbation play a role in the development of co-occurring substance use disorders and mood and anxiety disorders.",

        "Mood, anxiety, and substance-use disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the population. Although several pharmacological treatments are available, they are not effective for a significant proportion of patients and are associated with several adverse reactions. Therefore, new treatments should be explored. Recent studies suggest that serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics including ayahuasca, psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) have anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects. Areas Covered: A systematic review of systematic reviews assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelic was performed using the PubMed data base until 11 April 2018. Systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis were analyzed, but only reviews that described at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) were included. Expert Commentary: Psilocybin and LSD reduced anxiety and depression in cancer patients and symptoms of alcohol and tobacco dependence, and ayahuasca reduced depression symptoms in treatment-resistant depression. Although the results are promising, several studies were open label, and only few were RCTs, and most had small sample sizes and a short duration. Single or few doses of these drugs seem to be well tolerated, but long-term studies are lacking. New RCTs with bigger samples and longer duration are needed to replicate these findings.",

        "In academic settings around the world, there is a resurgence of interest in using psychedelic substances for the treatment of addictions, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and other diagnoses. This case series describes the medical consequences of accidental overdoses in three individuals. Case series of information were gathered from interviews, health records, case notes, and collateral reports. The first case report documents significant improvements in mood symptoms, including reductions in mania with psychotic features, following an accidental lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) overdose, changes that have been sustained for almost 20 years. The second case documents how an accidental overdose of LSD early in the first trimester of pregnancy did not negatively affect the course of the pregnancy or have any obvious teratogenic or other negative developmental effects on the child. The third report indicates that intranasal ingestion of 550 times the normal recreational dosage of LSD was not fatal and had positive effects on pain levels and subsequent morphine withdrawal. There appear to be unpredictable, positive sequelae that ranged from improvements in mental illness symptoms to reduction in physical pain and morphine withdrawal symptoms. Also, an LSD overdose while in early pregnancy did not appear to cause harm to the fetus. ",

        "Psychedelic-assisted therapies are experiencing a re-emergence in mainstream medicine and mental health contexts. A wide variety of psychedelic-assisted therapy modalities are being utilized to address mental health issues such as substance use disorders, end of life anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, suicidality, PTSD and other conditions. The novel and inchoate acceptance of psychedelic-assisted therapies into mainstream medical and therapeutic realms raises questions of equity. Concerns have been raised that individuals and communities facing structural inequities are perhaps least able to access these treatments including Black, Indigenous and people of colour (BIPOC) as well as people who use drugs. Psychedelic-assisted therapies may exemplify the inverse law of care whereby services are most inaccessible to communities with the most need, especially if these therapies are regulated into the private sector. As legalization and wider implementation of these therapies appears to be imminent, now is a critical time to consider how health equity may be promoted within psychedelic medicine. This paper examines how the EQUIP Health Care approach (https://equiphealthcare.ca) may inform the development and provision of equity-oriented psychedelic-assisted therapies. The EQUIP approach seeks to reduce the effects of structural inequities on people's health, the impacts of discrimination and stigma, and the mismatches between usual approaches to care and the needs of people most affected by health and social inequities. Key dimensions of the EQUIP intervention include cultural safety, harm reduction, trauma and violence-informed care, and contextual tailoring.",

        "Clinically significant anxiety and depression are common in patients with cancer, and are associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks. Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60-80% of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression. In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.

        "Synthetic cannabinoids (SC) are a heterogeneous group of compounds developed to probe the endogenous cannabinoid system or as potential therapeutics. Clandestine laboratories subsequently utilized published data to develop SC variations marketed as abusable designer drugs. In the early 2000s, SC became popular as \"legal highs\" under brand names such as Spice and K2, in part due to their ability to escape detection by standard cannabinoid screening tests. The majority of SC detected in herbal products have greater binding affinity to the cannabinoid CB1 receptor than does D(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in the cannabis plant, and greater affinity at the CB1 than the CB2 receptor. In vitro and animal in vivo studies show SC pharmacological effects 2-100 times more potent than THC, including analgesic, anti-seizure, weight-loss, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer growth effects. SC produce physiological and psychoactive effects similar to THC, but with greater intensity, resulting in medical and psychiatric emergencies. Human adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath or depressed breathing, hypertension, tachycardia, chest pain, muscle twitches, acute renal failure, anxiety, agitation, psychosis, suicidal ideation, and cognitive impairment. Long-term or residual effects are unknown. Due to these public health consequences, many SC are classified as controlled substances. However, frequent structural modification by clandestine laboratories results in a stream of novel SC that may not be legally controlled or detectable by routine laboratory tests. We present here a comprehensive review, based on a systematic electronic literature search, of SC epidemiology and pharmacology and their clinical implications. ",

        "Ayahuasca is a natural psychoactive brew, used in traditional ceremonies in the Amazon basin. Recent research has indicated that ayahuasca is pharmacologically safe and its use may be positively associated with improvements in psychiatric symptoms. The mechanistic effects of ayahuasca are yet to be fully established. In this prospective naturalistic study, 63 self-selected participants took part in ayahuasca ceremonies at a retreat centre in the Peruvian Amazon. Participants undertook the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Self-compassion Scale (SCS), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), as well as secondary measures, pre- and post-retreat and at 6-months. Participants also provided saliva samples for pre/post epigenetic analysis. Overall, a statistically significant decrease in BDI-II (13.9 vs. 6.1,  < 0.001), STAI (44.4 vs. 34.3  < 0.001) scores, and CORE-OM scores were observed (37.3 vs. 22.3  < 0.001) at post-retreat, as well as a concurrent increase in SCS (3.1 vs. 3.6,  < 0.001). Psychometric improvements were sustained, and on some measures values further decreased at 6-month follow-up, suggesting a potential for lasting therapeutic effects. Changes in memory valence were linked to the observed psychometric improvements. Epigenetic findings were equivocal, but indicated that further research in candidate genes, such as sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1 (SIGMAR1), is warranted. This data adds to the literature supporting ayahuasca's possible positive impact on mental health when conducted in a ceremonial context. Further investigation into clinical samples, as well as greater analyses into the mechanistic action of ayahuasca is advised. ",

        "Two intravenous doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (0.022 mg/kg and 0.044 mg/kg) were compared to intravenous diazepam (0.157 mg/kg) and to placebo (Ringer's lactate) as premedication for dental extraction in 10 healthy volunteers. Pain detection and tolerance thresholds were measured and psychiatric interviews were supplemented by Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventories (MMPI), the Zung Depression Scale (ZDS), Beck Depression Inventories (BDI), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Pain detection thresholds were altered unpredictably with high THC doses, but analgesia as indicated by pain tolerance was less than that after diazepam and placebo. In three subjects low-dose THC (0.022 mg/kg) was a better analgesic than placebo but not diazepam. Six subjects preferred placebo to low-dose THC as an analgesic; this group experienced increases in subjective surgical pain and were submissive, rigid, and less introspective with high State Anxiety and MMPI profiles that differed from subjects whose pain was not increased. STAI following THC presaged a poor analgesic response in this group.",

        "Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

        "Approximately 188 million people use cannabis yearly worldwide, and it has recently been legalised in 11 US states, Canada, and Uruguay for recreational use. The potential for increased cannabis use highlights the need to better understand its risks, including the acute induction of psychotic and other psychiatric symptoms. We aimed to investigate the effect of the cannabis constituent D-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alone and in combination with cannabidiol (CBD) compared with placebo on psychiatric symptoms in healthy people. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies published in English between database inception and May 21, 2019, with a within-person, crossover design. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting symptoms using psychiatric scales (the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]) following the acute administration of intravenous, oral, or nasal THC, CBD, and placebo in healthy participants, and presenting data that allowed calculation of standardised mean change (SMC) scores for positive (including delusions and hallucinations), negative (such as blunted affect and amotivation), and general (including depression and anxiety) symptoms. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to assess the main outcomes of the effect sizes for total, positive, and negative PANSS and BPRS scores measured in healthy participants following THC administration versus placebo. Because the number of studies to do a meta-analysis on CBD's moderating effects was insufficient, this outcome was only systematically reviewed. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136674. 15 eligible studies involving the acute administration of THC and four studies on CBD plus THC administration were identified. Compared with placebo, THC significantly increased total symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in nine studies, with ten independent samples, involving 196 participants: SMC 1*10 [95% CI 0*92-1*28], p<0*0001); positive symptom severity (assessed in 14 studies, with 15 independent samples, involving 324 participants: SMC 0*91 [95% CI 0*68-1*14], p<0*0001); and negative symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in 12 studies, with 13 independent samples, involving 267 participants: SMC 0*78 [95% CI 0*59-0*97], p<0*0001). In the systematic review, of the four studies evaluating CBD's effects on THC-induced symptoms, only one identified a significant reduction in symptoms. A single THC administration induces psychotic, negative, and other psychiatric symptoms with large effect sizes. There is no consistent evidence that CBD induces symptoms or moderates the effects of THC. These findings highlight the potential risks associated with the use of cannabis and other cannabinoids that contain THC for recreational or therapeutic purposes.

        "Psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), and mescaline exhibit intense effects on the human brain and behaviour. In recent years, there has been a surge in studies investigating these drugs because clinical studies have shown that these once banned drugs are well tolerated and efficacious in medically supervised low doses called microdosing. Psychedelics have demonstrated efficacy in treating neuropsychiatric maladies such as difficult to treat anxiety, depression, mood disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress disorder, and also in treating substance use disorders. The primary mode of action of psychedelics is activation of serotonin 5-HT receptors affecting cognition and brain connectivity through the modulation of several downstream signalling pathways via complex molecular mechanisms. Some atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) primarily exhibit pharmacological actions through 5-HT receptors, which are also the target of psychedelic drugs. Psychedelic drugs including the newer second generation along with the glutamatergic APDs are thought to mediate pharmacological actions through a common pathway, i.e., a complex serotonin-glutamate receptor interaction in cortical neurons of pyramidal origin. Furthermore, psychedelic drugs have been reported to act via a complex interplay between 5HT, mGlu2/3, and NMDA receptors to mediate neurobehavioral and pharmacological actions. Findings from recent studies have suggested that serotoninergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions are very closely connected in producing pharmacological responses to psychedelics and antipsychotic medication. Emerging hypotheses suggest that psychedelics work through brain resetting mechanisms. Hence, there is a need to dig deeply into psychedelic neurobiology to uncover how psychedelics could best be used as scientific tools to benefit psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. ",

        "Microdosing psychedelics-the regular consumption of small amounts of psychedelic substances such as LSD or psilocybin-is a growing trend in popular culture. Recent studies on full-dose psychedelic psychotherapy reveal promising benefits for mental well-being, especially for depression and end-of-life anxiety. While full-dose therapies include perception-distorting properties, microdosing mayprovide complementary clinical benefits using lower-risk, non-hallucinogenic doses. This pre-registered study aimed to investigate whether microdosing psychedelics is related to differences in personality, mental health, and creativity. In this observational study, respondents recruited from online forums self-reported their microdosing behaviors and completed questionnaires concerning dysfunctional attitudes, wisdom, negative emotionality, open-mindedness, and mood. Respondents also performed the Unusual Uses Task to assess their creativity. Current and former microdosers scored lower on measures of dysfunctional attitudes (p < 0.001, r = - 0.92) and negative emotionality (p = 0.009, r = - 0.85) and higher on wisdom (p < 0.001, r = 0.88), openmindedness(p = 0.027, r = 0.67), and creativity (p < 0.001, r = 0.15) when compared to non-microdosing controls. These findings provide promising initial evidence that warrants controlled experimental research to directly test safety and clinical efficacy. As microdoses are easier to administer than full-doses, this new paradigm has the exciting potential to shape future psychedelic research. ",

        "Among adolescents and young adults, cannabis use is prevalent. Prior studies characterizing withdrawal effects in this age range have primarily included treatment seeking or comorbid psychiatric samples; these studies have identified several affected domains, especially sleep, mood, and anxiety. The present study compared a community (i.e., nontreatment seeking) sample of cannabis-using and control participants on mood, anxiety, sleep, and withdrawal inventories during the course of a monitored 3-week cannabis abstinence period.  Seventy-nine adolescent and young adult participants (cannabis-using group=37 and control group=42) were recruited from the community to undergo 3 weeks of confirmed abstinence (i.e., urine and sweat patch toxicology) and completion of Cannabis Withdrawal Symptom Criteria, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck's Depression Inventory, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index across the study period. Repeated measures and cross-sectional regressions were used to examine main effects of group and interactions with time (where appropriate), while accounting for recent alcohol use and cotinine levels.  Cannabis-using participants reported higher mood (=0.006), overall withdrawal (=0.009), and sleep-related withdrawal (<0.001) symptoms across abstinence compared to controls. Overall withdrawal severity (=0.04) and sleep-related withdrawal symptoms (=0.02) demonstrated a quadratic trajectory across the monitored abstinence periods, with an increase from baseline and subsequent decreases in symptom severity. No differences of anxiety scores (=0.07) or trajectories (=0.18) were observed. By study completion, groups did not differ among sleep quality components (all >.05).  These findings revealed that nontreatment-seeking cannabis-using adolescents and young adults reported heightened total withdrawal symptoms during a 3-week sustained abstinence period relative to controls. Cannabis-using participants demonstrated an increase in withdrawal symptom trajectory during the first week followed by decreased symptoms from weeks 2 to 3, which contrasts with prior linear decreases observed in cannabis-using adolescent and young adults. More mood symptoms were observed in the cannabis-using group even while excluding for comorbid psychopathologies-along with significantly more sleep problems during the abstinence period. Implications include the necessity to provide psychoeducation for recreational, nontreatment-seeking cannabis-using individuals about cannabis withdrawal, mood symptoms, and sleep quality difficulties when cannabis cessation is attempted, to improve likelihood of long-term sustained abstinence.

        "Stimulants such as methylphenidate and modafinil are frequently used as cognitive enhancers in healthy people, whereas 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) is proposed to enhance mood and empathy in healthy subjects. However, comparative data on the effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on negative emotions in healthy subjects have been partially missing. The aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on the neural correlates of fearful face processing using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine as a positive control. Using a double-blind, within-subject, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 60 mg methylphenidate, 600 mg modafinil, and 125 mg 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine were administrated to 22 healthy subjects while performing an event-related fMRI task to assess brain activation in response to fearful faces. Negative mood states were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and subjective ratings. Relative to placebo, modafinil, but not methylphenidate or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, increased brain activation within a limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit during fearful face processing. Modafinil but not methylphenidate also increased amygdala responses to fearful faces compared with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Furthermore, activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyrus in response to fearful faces correlated positively with subjective feelings of fearfulness and depressiveness after modafinil administration. Despite the cognitive enhancement effects of 600 mg modafinil in healthy people, potential adverse effects on emotion processing should be considered. ",

        "Kratom, a plant that produces opioid-like effects, has gained popularity in the U.S. for self-treating symptoms of chronic pain, mood disorders, and substance-use disorders (SUDs). Most data on kratom are from surveys into which current kratom-using adults could self-select; such surveys may underrepresent people who have used kratom and chosen to stop. Available data also do not adequately assess important psychosocial factors surrounding kratom use. In this study, U.S. adults who reported past 6-month alcohol, opioid, and/or stimulant use ( = 1,670) were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk between September and December 2020. Of the 1,510 evaluable respondents, 202 (13.4%) reported lifetime kratom use. Kratom-using adults, relative to others, were typically younger, male, unpartnered, without children, and had lower income. They had higher rates of chronic pain (31.7% vs. 21.9%,  = .003), childhood adversity, anxiety, and depression ( < .001), and lower perceived social rank ( = .19, .02-.22) and socioeconomic status ( = .37 .16-.26). They also reported higher use rates for most substances (except alcohol); this included medically supervised and unsupervised use of prescription opioids and diverted opioid agonist therapy (OAT) medications. Most (83.2%) met diagnostic criteria for any past-year SUD. Those reporting kratom use were less likely to reside in an urban/suburban area. The strongest predictors of kratom use were use of other drugs: cannabidiol ( = 3.73), psychedelics ( = 3.39), and nonmedical prescription opioids ( = 1.72). Another strong predictor was lifetime OAT utilization ( = 2.31). Despite seemingly poorer psychosocial functioning and health among respondents reporting lifetime kratom use, use of other substances may be the strongest indicators of kratom use.

        "Cannabigerol (CBG), and its precursor before decarboxylation, cannabigerolic acid is sometimes labeled the \"mother of all cannabinoids.\" The purpose of the present study was to investigate reasons for use and self-reported therapeutic effects in CBG-predominant cannabis users. Usage patterns and adverse effects, including withdrawal symptoms were also explored.  Cannabidiol-predominant cannabis users were recruited online to complete an online survey assessing CBG use patterns, conditions treated with CBG-predominant cannabis (containing >50% CBG), perceived efficacy, associated adverse events, and withdrawal symptoms. One hundred twenty-seven eligible participants (U.S. residents ages 21+ who reported using CBG-predominant cannabis in the past 6 months) completed the survey.  Most of the samples (=65; 51.2%) reported use of CBG-predominant products solely for medical purposes (=46; 36.2% reported use for medical and recreational purposes; =8; 6.3% reported recreational use only, and =8 were missing). The most common conditions the complete sample reported using CBG to treat were anxiety (51.2%), chronic pain (40.9%), depression (33.1%), and insomnia/disturbed sleep (30.7%). Efficacy was highly rated, with the majority reporting their conditions were \"very much improved\" or \"much improved\" by CBG. Furthermore, 73.9% claimed superiority of CBG-predominant cannabis over conventional medicines for chronic pain, 80% for depression, 73% for insomnia, and 78.3% for anxiety. Forty-four percent of CBG-predominant cannabis users reported no adverse events, with 16.5% noting dry mouth, 15% sleepiness, 11.8% increased appetite, and 8.7% dry eyes. Around 84.3% reported no withdrawal symptoms, with sleep difficulties representing the most frequently endorsed withdrawal symptom (endorsed by two respondents).  This is the first patient survey of CBG-predominant cannabis use to date, and the first to document self-reported efficacy of CBG-predominant products, particularly for anxiety, chronic pain, depression, and insomnia. Most respondents reported greater efficacy of CBG-predominant cannabis over conventional pharmacotherapy, with a benign adverse event profile and negligible withdrawal symptoms. This study establishes that humans are employing CBG and suggests that CBG-predominant cannabis-based medicines should be studied in randomized controlled trials. ",

        "There is a need for new, effective treatments for patients with (treatment-resistant) depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd). At the same time, there is renewed interest in psychedelics for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.<br/> AIM: To provide an overview of results from past and current research into psychedelics in the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders and ocd.<br/> METHOD: Literature search in Medline and PubMed databases, supplemented with cross-references and results from recent studies.<br/> RESULTS: There is a considerable evidence base for the atypical psychedelic ketamine. Ketamine has a rapid, beneficial effect on depression and suicidality; longer-term effects are less clear. Research into classical psychedelics for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders is currently limited to a few small (open label) studies, although positive outcomes are reported even after a single administration, with potentially longer lasting benefits. Studies must be repeated in larger and more diverse groups of patients.<br/> CONCLUSION: Further research into efficacy, therapeutic mechanisms and intervention models is very worthwhile; for the benefit of patients, but also to provide a deeper insight into the psychotherapeutic and neurobiological mechanisms that play a role in (the treatment of) common mental disorders.",

        "Combination tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) medicines or CBD-only medicines are prospective treatments for chronic pain, stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. THC and CBD increase signaling from cannabinoid receptors, which reduces synaptic transmission in parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems and reduces the secretion of inflammatory factors from immune and glial cells. The overall effect of adding CBD to THC medicines is to enhance the analgesic effect but counteract some of the adverse effects. There is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of THC/CBD combination medicines for chronic pain, especially neuropathic and nociplastic pain or pain with an inflammatory component. For CBD-only medication, there is substantial evidence for stress, moderate evidence for anxiety and insomnia, and minimal evidence for depression and pain. THC/CBD combination medicines have a good tolerability and safety profile relative to opioid analgesics and have negligible dependence and abuse potential; however, should be avoided in patients predisposed to depression, psychosis and suicide as these conditions appear to be exacerbated. Non-serious adverse events are usually dose-proportional, subject to tachyphylaxis and are rarely dose limiting when patients are commenced on a low dose with gradual up-titration. THC and CBD inhibit several Phase I and II metabolism enzymes, which increases the exposure to a wide range of drugs and appropriate care needs to be taken. Low-dose CBD that appears effective for chronic pain and mental health has good tolerability and safety, with few adverse effects and is appropriate as an initial treatment.",

        "Cannabis, Cannabis sativa L., is used to produce a resin that contains high levels of cannabinoids, particularly delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which are psychoactive substances. Although cannabis use is illegal in France and in many other countries, it is widely used for its relaxing or euphoric effects, especially by adolescents and young adults. What are the adverse effects of cannabis on health? During consumption? And in the long term? Does cannabis predispose users to the development of psychotic disorders? To answer these questions, we reviewed the available evidence using the standard Prescrire methodology. The long-term adverse effects of cannabis are difficult to evaluate. Since and associated substances, with or without the user's knowledge. Tobacco and alcohol consumption, and particular lifestyles and behaviours are often associated with cannabis use. Some traits predispose individuals to the use of psychoactive substances in general. The effects of cannabis are dosedependent.The most frequently report-ed adverse effects are mental slowness, impaired reaction times, and sometimes accentuation of anxiety. Serious psychological disorders have been reported with high levels of intoxication. The relationship between poor school performance and early, regular, and frequent cannabis use seems to be a vicious circle, in which each sustains the other. Many studies have focused on the long-term effects of cannabis on memory, but their results have been inconclusive. There do not * About fifteen longitudinal cohort studies that examined the influence of cannabis on depressive thoughts or suicidal ideation have yielded conflicting results and are inconclusive. Several longitudinal cohort studies have shown a statistical association between psychotic illness and self-reported cannabis use. However, the results are difficult to interpret due to methodological problems, particularly the unknown reliability of self-reported data. It has not been possible to establish a causal relationship in either direction, because of these methodological limitations. In Australia, the marked increase in cannabis use has not been accompanied by an increased incidence of schizophrenia. On the basis of the available data, we cannot reach firm conclusions on whether or not cannabis use causes psychosis. It seems prudent to inform apparently vulnerable individuals that cannabis may cause acute psychotic decompensation, especially at high doses. Users can feel dependent on cannabis, but this dependence is usually psychological. Withdrawal symptoms tend to occur within 48 hours following cessation of regular cannabis use, and include increased irritability, anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, sleep difficulties and aggression. Symptoms subside within 2 to 12 weeks. Driving under the influence of cannabis doubles the risk of causing a fatal road accident. Alcohol consumption plays an even greater role. A few studies and a number of isolated reports suggest that cannabis has a role in the occurrence of cardiovascular adverse effects, especially in patients with coronary heart disease. Numerous case-control studies have investigated the role of cannabis in the incidence of some types of cancer. Its role has not been ruled out, but it is not possible to determine whether the risk is distinct from that of the tobacco with which it is often smoked. Studies that have examined the influence of cannabis use on the clinical course of hepatitis C are inconclusive. Alcohol remains the main toxic agent that hepatitis C patients should avoid. In practice, the adverse effects of low-level, recreational cannabis use are generally minor, although they can apparently be serious in vulnerable individuals. The adverse effects of cannabis appear overall to be less serious than those of alcohol, in terms of neuropsychological and somatic effects, accidents and violence.",

        "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine may have rapid, albeit transient, antidepressant properties. This study in patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRD) aimed to (1) replicate the acute efficacy of single-dose intravenous (i.v.) ketamine; (2) test the efficacy of the glutamate-modulating agent riluzole in preventing post-ketamine relapse; and (3) examine whether pretreatment with lamotrigine would attenuate ketamine's psychotomimetic effects and enhance its antidepressant activity. Twenty-six medication-free patients received open-label i.v. ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Two hours prior to infusion, patients were randomized to lamotrigine (300 mg) or placebo. Seventeen patients (65%) met response criterion (50% reduction from baseline on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) 24 h following ketamine. Lamotrigine failed to attenuate the mild, transient side-effects associated with ketamine and did not enhance its antidepressant effects. Fourteen patients (54%) met response criterion 72 h following ketamine and proceeded to participate in a 32-d, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose continuation trial of riluzole (100-200 mg/d). The main outcome measure was time-to-relapse. An interim analysis found no significant differences in time-to-relapse between riluzole and placebo groups [log-rank chi(2) = 0.17, d.f. = 1, p = 0.68], with 80% of patients relapsing on riluzole vs. 50% on placebo. The trial was thus stopped for futility. This pilot study showed that a sub-anaesthetic dose of i.v. ketamine is well-tolerated in TRD, and may have rapid and sustained antidepressant properties. Riluzole did not prevent relapse in the first month following ketamine. Further investigation of relapse prevention strategies post-ketamine is necessary.",

        "Etifoxine is an anxiolytic compound structurally unrelated to benzodiazepine and neurosteroids but potentiating GABA(A) receptor function by a dual mode of action including a direct positive allosteric modulation through a site distinct from that of benzodiazepines. Etifoxine has been shown to possess some anxiolytic-like effects in rodents. Using the four-plate test (FPT) model of anxiety in mice the potential anxiolytic-like effect of etifoxine was first to re-evaluate. In a second part, in order to better understand the mechanism of action of etifoxine, interaction studies with 5-HT(2) ligands were performed in the FPT as mixed serotonergic and GABAergic mechanisms are highly implicated in the anxiolytic-like effect observed in the FPT. A dose response effect was observed for etifoxine from the dose of 40-100 mg/kg. Doses above to 60 mg/kg induced a sedative effect as was determined in the actimeter test. The 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist SR 46349B blocked the anti-punishment activity of etifoxine (40 and 50 mg/kg), while the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist, SB 206553 and the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist, RS 10-2221 did not alter its effects. In a same way, only the 5-HT(2A) agonist DOI induced anti-punishment effect when co-administered with subthreshold doses of etifoxine. The present results demonstrated that etifoxine effect was modulated by 5-HT(2A) ligands co-administration. The large literature concerning GABA and 5-HT suggests that they could be co-released and could act as co-transmitters in some regions of the CNS and cross-communication between the two neurotransmitters might be an important modulator process of neuronal activity.

        "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent hallucinogenic substance that was extensively investigated by psychiatrists during the 1950s and 1960s. Researchers were interested in the unique effects induced by this substance, some of which resemble symptoms seen in schizophrenia. Moreover, during that period LSD was studied and used for the treatment of several mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, addiction and personality disorders. Despite this long history of research, how LSD induces its specific effects on a neuronal level has been relatively unclear. In recent years there has been a revival of research in hallucinogenic drugs and their possible clinical applications. These contemporary studies in the UK and Switzerland include neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this review, we collect and interpret these recent neuroimaging findings. Overall, previous results across studies indicate that LSD administration is associated with extensive alterations in functional brain connectivity, measuring the correlated activities between different brain regions. The studies mostly reported increases in connectivity between regions and, more specifically, consistently found increased connectivity within the thalamocortical system. These latter observations are in agreement with models proposing that hallucinogenic drugs exert their effects by inhibiting cerebral filtering of external and internal data. However, studies also face several limitations, including potential biases of neuroimaging measurements.",

        "Psychedelics have inspired new hope for treating brain disorders, as they seem to be unlike any treatments currently available. Not only do they produce sustained therapeutic effects following a single administration, they also appear to have broad therapeutic potential, demonstrating efficacy for treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorder, and alcohol use disorder, among others. Psychedelics belong to a more general class of compounds known as psychoplastogens, which robustly promote structural and functional neural plasticity in key circuits relevant to brain health. Here we discuss the importance of structural plasticity in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, as well as the evidence demonstrating that psychedelics are among the most effective chemical modulators of neural plasticity studied to date. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical framework with the potential to explain why psychedelic compounds produce long-lasting therapeutic effects across a wide range of brain disorders. Despite their promise as broadly efficacious neurotherapeutics, there are several issues associated with psychedelic-based medicines that drastically limit their clinical scalability. We discuss these challenges and how they might be overcome through the development of non-hallucinogenic psychoplastogens. The clinical use of psychedelics and other psychoplastogenic compounds marks a paradigm shift in neuropsychiatry toward therapeutic approaches relying on the selective modulation of neural circuits with small molecule drugs. Psychoplastogen research brings us one step closer to actually curing mental illness by rectifying the underlying pathophysiology of disorders like depression, moving beyond simply treating disease symptoms. However, determining how to most effectively deploy psychoplastogenic medicines at scale will be an important consideration as the field moves forward.",

        "Repeated ecstasy (MDMA) use is reported to impair cognition and cause increased feelings of depression and anxiety. Yet, many relevant studies have failed to control for use of drugs other than MDMA, especially marijuana (THC). To address these confounding effects we compared behavioural performance of 11 MDMA/THC users, 15 THC users and 15 non-drug users matched for age and intellect. We tested the hypothesis that reported feelings of depression and anxiety and cognitive impairment (memory, executive function and decision making) are more severe in MDMA/THC users than in THC users. MDMA/THC users reported more intense feelings of depression and anxiety than THC users and non-drug users. Memory function was impaired in both groups of drug users. MDMA/THC users showed slower psychomotor speed and less mental flexibility than non-drug users. THC users exhibited less mental flexibility and performed worse on the decision making task compared to non-drug users but these functions were similar to those in MDMA/THC users. It was concluded that MDMA use is associated with increased feelings of depression and anxiety compared to THC users and non-drug users. THC users were impaired in some cognitive abilities to the same degree as MDMA/THC users, suggesting that some cognitive impairment attributed to MDMA is more likely due to concurrent THC use.",

        "People with substance use disorders (SUDs) frequently present to treatment with polysubstance use and mental health comorbidities. Different combinations of substance use and mental health problems require different treatment approaches. Our study aimed to: (i) identify the shared substance use classes among young people at treatment admission, (ii) determine which mental health symptoms, quality of life (QoL) and service types were associated with the identified substance use classes, and (iii) prospectively determine which substance use classes and service types were more likely to complete treatment. Cross-sectional and prospective study using service and outcome data. Substance use treatment services in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. De-identified service and outcome measure data were extracted from the files of 744 clients aged 18-35 years (48% male) admitted into seven residential and four day-treatment programmes. Substance use and severity among tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants, opioids, sedatives and inhalants. Other variables included: depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and psychotic symptoms, as well as QoL. Latent class analysis identified three polysubstance use classes: wide-ranging polysubstance users (WRPU; 22.45%), primary amphetamine users (56.45%) and alcohol and cannabis users (21.10%). The WRPU class had higher odds of psychotic symptoms than the alcohol and cannabis use class [odds ratio (OR) = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-1.11]; and double the odds of residential programme enrolment than those in the amphetamine use class (OR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.50-3.68). No other class differences on mental health or QoL variables were found. Clients enrolled in day-programmes had higher odds of completing treatment. There appear to be high levels of polysubstance use among young people entering substance use treatment in Australia. Wide-ranging polysubstance users were more likely to report psychotic symptoms and be enrolled into a residential programme than primary amphetamine users and alcohol and cannabis users. ",

        "Ayahuasca is the Quechua name for a tea obtained from the vine Banisteriopsis caapi, and used for ritual purposes by the indigenous populations of the Amazon. The use of a variation of the tea that combines B. caapi with the leaves of the shrub Psychotria viridis has experienced unprecedented expansion worldwide for its psychotropic properties. This preparation contains the psychedelic 5-HT receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from P. viridis, plus b-carboline alkaloids with monoamine-oxidase-inhibiting properties from B. caapi. Acute administration induces a transient modified state of consciousness characterized by introspection, visions, enhanced emotions and recollection of personal memories. A growing body of evidence suggests that ayahuasca may be useful to treat substance use disorders, anxiety and depression. Here we review the pharmacology and neuroscience of ayahuasca, and the potential psychological mechanisms underlying its therapeutic potential. We discuss recent findings indicating that ayahuasca intake increases certain mindfulness facets related to acceptance and to the ability to take a detached view of one's own thoughts and emotions. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that ayahuasca shows promise as a therapeutic tool by enhancing self-acceptance and allowing safe exposure to emotional events. We postulate that ayahuasca could be of use in the treatment of impulse-related, personality and substance use disorders and also in the handling of trauma. More research is needed to assess the full potential of ayahuasca in the treatment of these disorders. ",

        "Resting EEG during open and closed eyes and subsequent mood ratings were obtained from 15 Ecstasy users and 14 Ecstasy-naive controls. Absolute spectral power on the scalp, and the three-dimensional, intracerebral distribution of neuroelectric activity using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) were computed. LORETA revealed global increases of theta, alpha 1 and beta 2/3 power during eyes open in Ecstasy users, and spectral analyses revealed a right-posterior increase of alpha 2 power (confirmed by LORETA) and increased beta band activity during open eyes. Ecstasy users had higher levels of state depressiveness, emotional excitability and a trend-level increase in state anxiety. The observed differences may be related to regular exposure to Ecstasy or other illicit drugs, or may be pre-existing.",

While international and domestic trials are currently underway, there is data demonstrating both the relative safety and potential efficacy of psilocybin. Psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners are essential mental health providers that may be at the forefront of delivering these new treatment modalities. Therefore, they must be aware of the psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic tenets of psilocybin to be prepared to treat patients.",

        "Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been the primary focus of cannabis research since 1964, when Raphael Mechoulam isolated and synthesized it. More recently, the synergistic contributions of cannabidiol to cannabis pharmacology and analgesia have been scientifically demonstrated. Other phytocannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabigerol and cannabichromene, exert additional effects of therapeutic interest. Innovative conventional plant breeding has yielded cannabis chemotypes expressing high titres of each component for future study. This review will explore another echelon of phytotherapeutic agents, the cannabis terpenoids: limonene, myrcene, a-pinene, linalool, b-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, nerolidol and phytol. Terpenoids share a precursor with phytocannabinoids, and are all flavour and fragrance components common to human diets that have been designated Generally Recognized as Safe by the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies. Terpenoids are quite potent, and affect animal and even human behaviour when inhaled from ambient air at serum levels in the single digits ng*mL(-1) . They display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute meaningfully to the entourage effects of cannabis-based medicinal extracts. Particular focus will be placed on phytocannabinoid-terpenoid interactions that could produce synergy with respect to treatment of pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Scientific evidence is presented for non-cannabinoid plant components as putative antidotes to intoxicating effects of THC that could increase its therapeutic index. Methods for investigating entourage effects in future experiments will be proposed. Phytocannabinoid-terpenoid synergy, if proven, increases the likelihood that an extensive pipeline of new therapeutic products is possible from this venerable plant. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bph.2011.163.issue-7.",

        "GABAergic drugs are of interest for the treatment of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, pain, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS), and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Some evidence suggests that TPA-023, (7-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(2-ethyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b] pyridazine), a GABA a2,3 subtype-selective GABA partial agonist and a antagonist, and the neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate, a GABA antagonist, may improve CIAS in pilot clinical trials. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of TPA-023 in mice after acute or subchronic (sc) treatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, phencyclidine (PCP), on novel object recognition (NOR), reversal learning (RL), and locomotor activity (LMA) in rodents. Acute TPA-023 significantly reversed scPCP-induced NOR and RL deficits. Co-administration of sub-effective dose (SED) TPA-023 with SEDs of the atypical antipsychotic drug, lurasidone, significantly potentiated the effect of TPA-023 in reversing the scPCP-induced NOR deficit. Further, scTPA-023 co-administration significantly prevented scPCP-induced NOR deficit for 5 weeks. Also, administration of TPA-023 for 7 days following scPCP reversed the NOR deficit for 1 week. However, TPA-023 did not blunt acute PCP-induced hyperactivity, suggesting lack of efficacy as a treatment for psychosis. Systemic TPA-023 significantly blocked lurasidone-induced increases in cortical acetylcholine, dopamine, and glutamate without affecting increases in norepinephrine and with minimal effect on basal release of these neurotransmitters. TPA-023 significantly inhibited PCP-induced cortical and striatal dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and glutamate efflux. These results suggest that TPA-023 and other GABA agonists may be of benefit to treat CIAS. ",

        "Ecstasy use has often been found to be associated with psychopathology, yet this research has so far been based largely on subjective symptom ratings. To investigate whether ecstasy users suffered from long-term psychopathological consequences. We compared the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) mental disorders in 30 current and 29 former ecstasy users, 29 polydrug and 30 drug-naive controls. Groups were approximately matched by age, gender and level of education. The current ecstasy users reported a life-time dose of an average of 821 and the former ecstasy users of 768 ecstasy tablets. Ecstasy users did not significantly differ from controls in the prevalence of mental disorders, except those related to substance use. Substance-induced affective, anxiety and cognitive disorders occurred more frequently among ecstasy users than polydrug controls. The life-time prevalence of ecstasy dependence amounted to 73% in the ecstasy user groups. More than half of the former ecstasy users and nearly half of the current ecstasy users met the criteria of substance-induced cognitive disorders at the time of testing. Logistic regression analyses showed the estimated life-time doses of ecstasy to be predictive of cognitive disorders, both current and life-time. The motivation for ecstasy use is not likely to be self-medication of pre-existing depressive or anxiety disorders as these did not occur more frequently in the ecstasy users than in control groups or in the general population. Cognitive disorders still present after over 5 months of ecstasy abstinence may well be functional consequences of serotonergic neurotoxicity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). ",

        "Psychedelic compounds hold the promise of changing the face of neuroscience and psychiatry as we know it. There have been numerous proposals to use them to treat a range of neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, addiction and PTSD; and trials to date have delivered positive results in favor of the novel therapeutics. Further to the medical use, the wider healthy population is gaining interest in these compounds. We see a surge in personal use of psychedelic drugs for reasons not limited to spiritual enhancement, improved productivity, aiding the management of non-pathological anxiety and depression, and recreational interests. Notably, microdosing-the practice of taking subacute doses of psychedelic compounds-is on the rise. Our knowledge about the effects of psychedelic compounds, however, especially in naturalistic settings, is still fairly limited. In particular, one of the largest gaps concerns the acute effects on cognition caused by psychedelics. Studies carried out to date are riddled with limitations such as having disparate paradigms, small sample sizes, and insufficient breadth of testing on both unhealthy  healthy volunteers. Moreover, the studies are majoritarily limited to laboratory settings and do not assess the effects at multiple dosages within the same paradigm nor at various points throughout the psychedelic experience. This review aims to summarize the studies to date in relation to how psychedelics acutely affect different domains of cognition. In the pursuit of illuminating the current limitations and offering long-term, forward-thinking solutions, this review compares and contrasts findings related to how psychedelics impact memory, attention, reasoning, social cognition, and creativity.

        "Few longitudinal cohort studies have focused on the impact of substances abused and psychiatric disorders on premature mortality. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of increased risk of drug related death and non drug related death in substance abusers of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/hypnotics, hallucinogens and alcohol over several decades. Follow-up study of a consecutive cohort of 561 substance abusers, admitted to a detoxification unit January 1970 to February 1978 in southern Sweden, and followed up in 2006. Demographic and clinical data, substance diagnoses and three groups of psychiatric diagnoses were identified at first admission. Causes of death were coded according to ICD-10 and classified as drug related deaths or non drug related deaths. To identify the incidence of some probable risk factors of drug related premature death, the data were subjected to a competing risks Cox regression analysis. Of 561 patients in the cohort, 11 individuals had either emigrated or could not be located, and 204/561 patients (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. The cumulative risk of drug related death increased more in the first 15 years and leveled out later on when non drug related causes of death had a similar incidence. In the final model, male gender, regular use of opiates or barbiturates at first admission, and neurosis were associated with an increased risk of drug related premature death, while cannabis use and psychosis were associated with a decreased risk. Neurosis, mainly depression and/or anxiety disorders, predicted drug related premature death while chronic psychosis and personality disorders did not. Chronic alcohol addiction was associated with increased risk of non drug related death. The cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature death to the age of 69. Drug related premature death was predicted by male gender, the use of opiates or barbiturates and depression and anxiety disorders at first admission. The predicted cumulative incidence of drug related death was significantly higher in opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have any impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related death. ",

        "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental illness composed of a heterogeneous collection of symptom clusters. The unique nature of PTSD as arising from a precipitating traumatic event helps simplify cross-species translational research modeling the neurobehavioral effects of stress and fear. However, the neurobiological progress on these complex neural circuits informed by animal models has yet to produce novel, evidence-based clinical treatment for PTSD. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of popular laboratory models of PTSD and provide concrete ideas for improving the validity and clinical translational value of basic research efforts in humans. We detail modifications to simplified animal paradigms to account for myriad cognitive factors affected in PTSD, which may contribute to abnormalities in regulating fear. We further describe new avenues for integrating different areas of psychological research underserved by animal models of PTSD. This includes incorporating emerging trends in the cognitive neuroscience of episodic memory, emotion regulation, social-emotional processes, and PTSD subtyping to provide a more comprehensive recapitulation of the human experience to trauma in laboratory research.",

        "lsd and other hallucinogens or psychedelics have been therapeutically used in psychiatry in the period between the Second World War and the late 1980s. In the past years renewed interest in the medical sciences for research and therapeutic use of these substances has evolved.<br/> AIM: A discussion of contemporary lsd research in the context of earlier research.<br/> METHOD: A systematic survey of the literature on the psychiatric use of lsd and the reactions towards lsd use in society.<br/> RESULTS: Since 1947 lsd has been therapeutically used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, addiction, post traumatic disorders, and other conditions. Since the early 1960s this use has been criticized because of the danger of evoking psychoses in patients, and because of the rise of a widespread non-medical use. However, there is no consolidated evidence-base for either the positive or the negative outcomes of lsd therapy.<br/> CONCLUSION: At this moment it is unpredictable whether lsd will make a comeback in psychiatry. Contemporary research attempts to evade all public controversy and to build up a solid evidence-base. Nevertheless it demonstrates a direct continuity with earlier research.",

A double-masked design with placebo control was used. Volunteer subjects were selected on the basis of high levels of train anxiety and were tested by two anxiety-inducing procedures--the mirror drawing test and the Stroop color-word test. Anxiety induced by the experimental procedure was alleviated by diazepam and, to a lesser extent, by nabilone. Since doses of the two drugs may not have been equivalent, or the time courses identical, conclusions about their relative efficacy must be guarded. The experimental model is unusual in that antianxiety drugs can be tested in volunteer subjects for true antianxiety effects rather than for side effects, such as cognitive or motor impairment, sleepiness, or other signs of central nervous system depression.",

        "Following decades of prohibition and widespread concern about their mind-altering properties, there is increasing public, scholarly, and clinical interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances. Serotonergic substances in particular (DMT, psilocybin, and LSD) are now being tested as treatments for such ailments as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. This thematic issue of  presents articles that investigate the cultural assumptions, political dimensions, and clinical and ethical implications that arise from this renewed interest. After reviewing ongoing debates on therapeutic mechanisms of action and the importance of context, we argue that psychedelics can be conceptualized as \"active super-placebos\"-that is, substances that enhance ritual, symbolic, and interpersonal therapeutic processes by increasing suggestibility and the influence of extra-pharmacological, \"non-specific\" factors. Rather than simply freeing up habitual constraints on perception, the articles in this issue support the claim that psychedelic encounters typically entail processes of sense-making, crystallization of meaning, and enculturation into contextually mediated assumptive worlds (or ideologies) and behaviours that necessarily install novel constraints with potentially maladaptive consequences. We highlight the importance of clinical and epistemic integrity in the framing of psychedelic therapies. The importance of structuring and providing oversight for the therapeutic context raises difficult questions about the search for appropriate forms of epistemic authority that are at once respectful of the plural cultural origins of psychedelic rituals and mindful of best practices and standards in clinical care.

        "The discovery of ketamine as a rapid-acting antidepressant spurred significant research to understand its underlying mechanisms of action and to identify other novel compounds that may act similarly. Serotonergic psychedelics (SPs) have shown initial promise in treating depression, though the challenge of conducting randomized controlled trials with SPs and the necessity of long-term clinical observation are important limitations. This review summarizes the similarities and differences between the psychoactive effects associated with both ketamine and SPs and the mechanisms of action of these compounds, with a focus on the monoaminergic, glutamatergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic, opioid, and inflammatory systems. Both molecular and neuroimaging aspects are considered. While their main mechanisms of action differ-SPs increase serotonergic signaling while ketamine is a glutamatergic modulator-evidence suggests that the downstream mechanisms of action of both ketamine and SPs include mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and downstream GABA receptor activity. The similarities in downstream mechanisms may explain why ketamine, and potentially SPs, exert rapid-acting antidepressant effects. However, research on SPs is still in its infancy compared to the ongoing research that has been conducted with ketamine. For both therapeutics, issues with regulation and proper controls should be addressed before more widespread implementation. This article is part of the Special Issue on \"Ketamine and its Metabolites\". ",

        "Indian hemp (lat. Cannabis sativa subs. Indica) has been used as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, medicine for some somatic diseases, and it is also used as a psychoactive substance. Cannabis can be used by smoking, evaporation, as a food ingredient, or as an extract. Acute and chronic cannabis use has been shown to be detrimental to several aspects of psychological and physical health and many experimental studies done on healthy people indicate the potential of D9- tetra hydro cannabinoid (THC) in inducing transient, dose-dependent psychotic symptoms, but also affective, behavioral, cognitive, neurovegetative, and psychophysical symptoms. Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug globally. In many communities, cannabis is perceived as a low-risk drug, leading to political lobbying to decriminalize its use. The wave of laws and initiatives to liberalize cannabis use continues to spread across the United States and the rest of the world, and there seems to be a political debate in the background about the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use. Aim is to present the possible consequences that the legalization of cannabis would have from the aspect of mental health and mental disorders. Authors reviewed the literature using PubMed resources on the effects of cannabis using the keywords: cannabis use, cannabis use and psychoticism, cannabis use and depression, cannabis use and anxiety, cannabis use and cognition, cannabis use and insomnia, legalization of cannabis. Authors examined the effects of cannabis use on psychiatric disorders and the review of the legal status of cannabis use in the world was also made. The possible consequences of cannabis legalization on the public health system were also considered, based on experiences from countries where legalization has already been done. The evidence cited in this article suggests that strong claims about the need to legalize cannabis are still questionable, and may, even in the long run, remain mixed, inconclusive, or even contradictory. Political interference in this issue can trigger a wide range of unintended but profound and lasting consequences for the health system and the health of the individual. We recommend further research on this topic and data collection with an emphasis on the effects and consequences of cannabis use on mental health, and in particular the benefits and harmful effects of medical cannabis use.

        "We examine the co-occurrence of abuse/dependence across different illicit drugs and test associations between these classes and major psychiatric disorders. Latent class analyses were used to characterize polysubstance abuse/dependence (AB/D) in 43 093 individuals who participated in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the association between the classes of life-time illicit drug AB/D and gender, age and race, as well as life-time Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia and antisocial personality disorder. Five latent classes were identified: no AB/D (class 1: 92.5%), cannabis AB/D only (class 2: 5.8%), stimulants + hallucinogen AB/D (class 3: 0.6%), prescription drug AB/D (class 4: 0.6%) and polysubstance AB/D (class 5: 0.5%). Major depressive disorder and nicotine dependence were associated most strongly with class 5. Anxiety disorders were associated strongly with the prescription drug AB/D class while alcohol AB/D and ASPD were associated with classes 2, 3, 4 and 5 when compared to the reference class (class 1). Significant heterogeneity exists in this US population for polysubstance AB/D patterns with evidence for a subgroup with high rates of sedative, tranquilizer and opiate AB/D and a history of anxiety disorders, a stimulant/hallucinogens group, a high-risk group with elevated rates of all psychiatric disorders and a milder cannabis AB/D only group. Replication of such classes across other samples has significant implications, such as characterizing risk groups that may be etiologically diverse. ",

        "Despite increased prevalence of maternal cannabis use, little is understood regarding potential long-term effects of prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) on neurodevelopmental outcomes. While neurodevelopmental cannabis exposure increases the risk of developing affective/mood disorders in adulthood, the precise neuropathophysiological mechanisms in male and female offspring are largely unknown. Given the interconnectivity of the endocannabinoid (ECb) system and the brain's fatty acid pathways, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to D-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may dysregulate fetal neurodevelopment through alterations of fatty-acid dependent synaptic and neuronal function in the mesolimbic system. To investigate this, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to vehicle or THC (3 mg/kg) from gestational day (GD)7 until GD22. Anxiety-like, depressive-like, and reward-seeking behavior, electrophysiology, and molecular assays were performed on adult male/female offspring. Imaging of fatty acids using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) was performed at prepubescence and adulthood. We report that PCE induces behavioral, neuronal, and molecular alterations in the mesolimbic system in male and female offspring, resembling neuropsychiatric endophenotypes. Additionally, PCE resulted in profound dysregulation of critical fatty acid pathways in the developing brain lipidome. Female progeny exhibited significant alterations to fatty acid levels at prepubescence but recovered from these deficits by early adulthood. In contrast, males exhibited persistent fatty acid deficits into adulthood. Moreover, both sexes maintained enduring abnormalities in glutamatergic/GABAergic function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These findings identify several novel long-term risks of maternal cannabis use and demonstrate for the first time, sex-related effects of maternal cannabinoid exposure directly in the developing neural lipidome.

        "Rats were given a single dose of reserpine (5 mg/kg s.c.) and behavioural responses to agonists at 5-HT receptor subtypes compared with those of control animals 21 days later. The following effects of activating postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors by the agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were significantly increased: tail-flick, reciprocal forepaw treading, flat body posture. The hyperphagic effect of activating presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors by 8-OH-DPAT tended to increase and hypothermia on activating postsynaptic 5-HT1A sites tended to decrease. The hyperlocomotor effect of activating 5-HT1A sites also tended to decrease possibly as a result of a dependence of this response on the known depletion of catecholamines by reserpine. Head shakes on activating 5-HT2A receptors by 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) and two effects of activating 5-HT2C receptors by 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP) were significantly increased (hypophagia, anxiety) and a third effect, hypolocomotion tended to increase but hypophagia on activating postsynaptic 5-HT1B receptors by CP-94, 253 was significantly attenuated. The results are discussed with particular reference to altered 5-HT function in depression.",

        "Classical psychedelics represent a family of psychoactive substances with structural similarities to serotonin and affinity for serotonin receptors. A growing number of studies have found that psychedelics can be effective in treating various psychiatric conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Mental health disorders are extremely prevalent in the general population constituting a major problem for the public health. There are a wide variety of interventions for mental health disorders, including pharmacological therapies and psychotherapies, however, treatment resistance still remains a particular challenge in this field, and relapse rates are also quite high. In recent years, psychedelics have become one of the promising new tools for the treatment of mental health disorders. In this review, we will discuss the three classic serotonergic naturally occurring psychedelics, psilocybin, ibogaine, and N, N-dimethyltryptamine, focusing on their pharmacological properties and clinical potential. The purpose of this article is to provide a focused review of the most relevant research into the therapeutic potential of these substances and their possible integration as alternative or adjuvant options to existing pharmacological and psychological therapies.",

        "To conduct a systematic review of modern-era (post-millennium) clinical studies assessing the therapeutic effects of serotonergic psychedelics drugs for mental health conditions. Although the main focus was on efficacy and safety, study characteristics, duration of antidepressants effects across studies, and the role of the subjective drug experiences were also reviewed and presented. A systematic literature search (1 Jan 2000 to 1 May 2020) was conducted in PubMed and PsychINFO for studies of patients undergoing treatment with a serotonergic psychedelic. Data from 16 papers, representing 10 independent psychedelic-assisted therapy trials (psilocybin = 7, ayahuasca = 2, LSD = 1), were extracted, presented in figures and tables, and narratively synthesized and discussed. Across these studies, a total of 188 patients suffering either cancer- or illness-related anxiety and depression disorders (C/I-RADD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or substance use disorder (SUD) were included. The reviewed studies established feasibility and evidence of safety, alongside promising early data of efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, OCD, and tobacco and alcohol use disorders. For a majority of patients, the therapeutic effects appeared to be long-lasting (weeks-months) after only 1 to 3 treatment session(s). All studies were conducted in line with guidelines for the safe conduct of psychedelic therapy, and no severe adverse events were reported. The resurrection of clinical psychedelic research provides early evidence for treatment efficacy and safety for a range of psychiatric conditions, and constitutes an exciting new treatment avenue in a health area with major unmet needs.

        "Inhibition of the isoform A of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A), a mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing deamination of monoamine neurotransmitters, is useful in treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. [C]harmine, a MAO-A PET radioligand, has been used to study mood disorders and antidepressant treatment. However, [C]harmine binding test-retest characteristics have to date only been partially investigated. Furthermore, since MAO-A is ubiquitously expressed, no reference region is available, thus requiring arterial blood sampling during PET scanning. Here, we investigate [C]harmine binding measurements test-retest properties; assess effects of using a minimally invasive input function estimation on binding quantification and repeatability; and explore binding potentials estimation using a reference region-free approach. Quantification of [C]harmine distribution volume (V) via kinetic models and graphical analyses was compared based on absolute test-retest percent difference (TRPD), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and identifiability. The optimal procedure was also used with a simultaneously estimated input function in place of the measured curve. Lastly, an approach for binding potentials quantification in absence of a reference region was evaluated. [C]harmine V estimates quantified using arterial blood and kinetic modeling showed average absolute TRPD values of 7.7 to 15.6 %, and ICC values between 0.56 and 0.86, across brain regions. Using simultaneous estimation (SIME) of input function resulted in V estimates close to those obtained using arterial input function (r = 0.951, slope = 1.073, intercept = - 1.037), with numerically but not statistically higher test-retest difference (range 16.6 to 22.0 %), but with overall poor ICC values, between 0.30 and 0.57. Prospective studies using [C]harmine are possible given its test-retest repeatability when binding is quantified using arterial blood. Results with SIME of input function show potential for simplifying data acquisition by replacing arterial catheterization with one arterial blood sample at 20 min post-injection. Estimation of [C]harmine binding potentials remains a challenge that warrants further investigation. ",

        "After a decades-long pause, psychedelics are again being intensely investigated for treating a wide range of neuropsychiatric ailments including depression, anxiety, addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder, anorexia, and chronic pain syndromes. The classic serotonergic psychedelics psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide and nonclassic psychedelics 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and ketamine are increasingly appreciated as neuroplastogens given their potential to fundamentally alter mood and behavior well beyond the time window of measurable exposure. Imaging studies with psychedelics are also helping advance our understanding of neural networks and connectomics. This resurgence in psychedelic science and psychedelic-assisted therapy has potential significance for the fields of neurosurgery and neuro-oncology and their diverse and challenging patients, many of whom continue to have mental health issues and poor quality of life despite receiving state-of-the-art care. In this study, we review recent and ongoing clinical trials, the set and setting model of psychedelic-assisted therapy, potential risks and adverse events, proposed mechanisms of action, and provide a perspective on how the safe and evidence-based use of psychedelics could potentially benefit many patients, including those with brain tumors, pain syndromes, ruminative disorders, stroke, SAH, TBI, and movement disorders. By leveraging psychedelics' neuroplastic potential to rehabilitate the mind and brain, novel treatments may be possible for many of these patient populations, in some instances working synergistically with current treatments and in some using subpsychedelic doses that do not require mind-altering effects for efficacy. This review aims to encourage broader multidisciplinary collaboration across the neurosciences to explore and help realize the transdiagnostic healing potential of psychedelics.",

        "This study describes the lifetime prevalence, correlates, and age of onset of selected psychiatric disorders among a community sample of MDMA users (n = 402), aged 18 to 30, in Ohio. Participants responded to interviewer-administered questionnaires, including sections of the computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV. Fifty-five percent of the sample had at least one lifetime disorder, with major depression (35.3%) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) (25.4%) the most common. Proportionately more women were diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while proportionately more men were diagnosed with ASPD. Proportionately more non-White participants had attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD). Higher levels of education were associated with proportionately less PTSD, ASPD, and AD/HD. Higher frequencies of MDMA use were associated with proportionately more ASPD and AD/HD. Comparing the age of first MDMA use with the age of onset for selected psychiatric disorders revealed that for most participants disorders preceded use. Multivariate analysis revealed participants with more than a high school education were less likely to have experienced a lifetime disorder, while those who had used MDMA more than 50 times were more likely. Variations in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders have practical implications for drug abuse prevention and treatment programs.",

        "To estimate and compare prevalence rates of lifetime health conditions by inferred duration of illicit drug use among the general U.S. adult population and to investigate associations between duration of use of each specific illicit drug (marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, or inhalant) and each lifetime health condition after controlling for potential confounding factors. Data from respondents aged 35 to 49 (N = 29,195) from the 2005-2007 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were analyzed. The prevalence rates of a broad range of health conditions by duration of use of specific illicit drug among persons 35 to 49 years of age in the United States were estimated and compared. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the results of 20 multivariate logistic regression models indicated positive associations between duration of marijuana use and anxiety, depression, sexually transmitted disease (STD), bronchitis, and lung cancer; between duration of cocaine use and anxiety and pancreatitis; between duration of heroin use and anxiety, hepatitis, and tuberculosis; between duration of hallucinogen use and tinnitus and STD; and between duration of inhalant use and anxiety, depression, HIV/AIDS, STD, tuberculosis, bronchitis, asthma, sinusitis, and tinnitus. This study provides initial analyses on the relationships between illicit drug use and health conditions based on a large nationally representative sample. These results can help prepare for treating health problems among former and continuing illicit drug users. ",

        "Recent research suggests that functional connectivity changes may be involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Hyperconnectivity in the default mode network has been associated with psychopathology, but psychedelic serotonin agonists like psilocybin may profoundly disrupt these dysfunctional neural network circuits and provide a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders. We have reviewed the current literature to investigate the efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. There were seven clinical trials that investigated psilocybin-assisted therapy as a treatment for psychiatric disorders related to anxiety, depression, and substance use. All trials demonstrated reductions in psychiatric rating scale scores or increased response and remission rates. There were large effect sizes related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. Psilocybin may also potentially reduce alcohol or tobacco use and increase abstinence rates in addiction, but the benefits of these two trials were less clear due to open-label study designs without statistical analysis. Psilocybin-assisted therapy efficacy and safety appear promising, but more robust clinical trials will be required to support FDA approval and identify the potential role in clinical psychiatry.",

        "Mental illness has a chronic course of illness with a number of clinical manifestations. Affected individuals experience significant functional, emotional, cognitive, and/or behavioral impairments. The growing prevalence of mental illness has been associated with significant social and economic costs. Indeed, the economic burden of mental illness is estimated to exceed $1.8 trillion USD over the next 30 years. A significant number of individuals affected by mental illness fail to respond to first-line treatment options. Therefore, there remains an unmet need for rapidly attenuating therapeutic options for mental health disorders with minimal social and economic burden. The paucity of novel treatment options warrants a renewed investigation of psychedelic-based psychotherapy. Herein, the authors will evaluate the therapeutic potential of traditional psychedelics, psilocybin, and MDMA, in the treatment of mental illness with a narrative review of available literature. Psychedelics, such as psilocybin and MDMA, offer an alternative avenue of therapy for many mental health disorders. Available evidence indicates that psychedelics may offer a single-dose, rapid effect model that have robust effects with treatment-resistant mental disorders and a unique advantage as a possible monotherapy for mental illness. Novel clinical trials that evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy in clinically representative populations are warranted. ",

        "This study aimed to characterize use and perceptions of cannabidiol (CBD) products.  Participants aged 16-65 years in Canada (=15,042) and the United States (=30,288) completed measures on prevalence and patterns of CBD product use and perceptions of CBD oil as part of the 2019 International Cannabis Policy Study online survey.  Past 12-month CBD product use was significantly more prevalent among respondents in the United States (26.1%) than in Canada (16.2%). Consumers in the United States and Canada reported using a range of CBD products, including drops (46.3% vs. 47.3%, respectively), topicals (26.0% vs. 16.7%), edibles/foods (23.8% vs. 17.6%), vape oils (18.9% vs. 13.3%), capsules (13.3% vs. 16.7%), and dried flower (10.1% vs. 16.1%). CBD was most commonly reported for management of pain, anxiety, and depression. Over half of CBD consumers in both countries reported that CBD oil was beneficial for health.  Use of CBD products is common in both the United States and Canada, primarily to manage self-reported health conditions for which there is little or no evidence of efficacy. Clearer public health messaging regarding the therapeutic effects of CBD is warranted. ",

        "The pharmacological treatment of patients with an eating disorder (ED) often includes medications to treat their ED, comorbid mental health problems, malnutrition and the physical health problems resulting from it. The currently approved pharmacological treatment options for EDs are limited to fluoxetine for bulimia nervosa (BN) and - in some countries - lisdexamfetamine for binge eating disorder (BED). Thus, there are no approved pharmacological options for anorexia nervosa (AN), even though study results for olanzapine and dronabinol are promising. Topiramate might be an additional future option for the treatment of BN and BED. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), mirtazapine and bupropion could be considered for the treatment of comorbid unipolar depression. However, AN and BN are contraindications for bupropion. For ED patients with a manic episode, we recommend olanzapine in AN and risperidone in BN and BED; whereas for bipolar depression, olanzapine (plus fluoxetine) seems appropriate in AN and lamotrigine in BN and BED. Acute anxiety or suicidality may warrant benzodiazepine treatment with lorazepam. Proton-pump inhibitors, gastroprokinetic drugs, laxatives and hormones can alleviate certain physical health problems caused by EDs. Therapeutic drug monitoring, pharmacogenomic testing, a more restrictive use of \"pro re nata\" (PRN) medication, an interdisciplinary treatment approach, shared decision making (SDM) and the formulation of common treatment goals by the patients, their family or carers and clinicians could improve treatment success and safety. Novel genetic, immunological, microbiome and brain imaging research as well as new pharmacological developments like the use of psychedelics, stimulants, novel monoaminergic drugs, hormone analogues and drugs which enhance the effects of psychotherapy may extend our therapeutic options in the near future.",

        "Suicide is one of the most important and increasing public health agenda around the world. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about the potential adverse impacts of the pandemic on suicide-related outcomes. The main objective of this study was to examine the association of psychosocial risk factors (mental health illnesses and social isolation) and substance use behaviors (cannabis and alcohol consumption) with suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic among Canadian adults. The study was conducted based on a total of 4005 persons 18 years of age or older, living in Canada's ten provinces. The data used in this study were collected during April 20-28, 2021, by Mental Health Research Canada. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, and other mood disorder) before and since COVID-19 outbreaks, social isolation and living arrangement, as well as cannabis and alcohol consumption with suicidal ideation during COVID-19. The results of adjusted logistic regression showed that the odds of suicidal ideation were 1.526 times higher (95% CI:1.082-2.152) among those who reported continued negative impacts of social isolation. The odds of suicidal ideation were also higher for those who were diagnosed as having depression before (OR = 3.136, 95% CI: 2.376-4.138) and since the COVID-19 pandemic (OR = 3.019, 95% CI:1.929-4.726) and 1.627 times higher (95% CI: 1.225-2.163) for those who were diagnosed as having anxiety before the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who reported having increased and those who were consuming cannabis during the pandemic were 1.970 (95% CI: 1.463-2.653) and 1.509 times (95% CI: 1.158-1.966) more likely to have thought of suicide than non-takers, respectively. Given the significant associations of psychosocial factors (mental health illnesses and social isolation) and cannabis use with suicidal ideation, more attention and support need to be given to adults who had mental health conditions before and since COVID-19, those who were negatively impacted by social isolation, and those are exposed to substance use (cannabis).

        "Serotonergic psychedelics are re-emerging as potential novel treatments for several psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder. The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) convened a task force to review the evidence and provide a consensus recommendation for the clinical use of psychedelic treatments for major depressive disorder. A systematic review was conducted to identify contemporary clinical trials of serotonergic psychedelics for the treatment of major depressive disorder and cancer-related depression. Studies published between January 1990 and July 2021 were identified using combinations of search terms, inspection of bibliographies and review of other psychedelic reviews and consensus statements. The levels of evidence for efficacy were graded according to the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments criteria. Only psilocybin and ayahuasca have contemporary clinical trials evaluating antidepressant effects. Two pilot studies showed preliminary positive effects of single-dose ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression (Level 3 evidence). Small randomized controlled trials of psilocybin combined with psychotherapy showed superiority to waitlist controls and comparable efficacy and safety to an active comparator (escitalopram with supportive psychotherapy) in major depressive disorder, with additional randomized controlled trials showing efficacy specifically in cancer-related depression (Level 3 evidence). There was only one open-label trial of psilocybin in treatment-resistant unipolar depression (Level 4 evidence). Small sample sizes and functional unblinding were major limitations in all studies. Adverse events associated with psychedelics, including psychological (e.g., psychotomimetic effects) and physical (e.g., nausea, emesis and headaches) effects, were generally transient. There is currently only low-level evidence to support the efficacy and safety of psychedelics for major depressive disorder. In Canada, as of 2022, psilocybin remains an experimental option that is only available through clinical trials or the special access program. As such, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments considers psilocybin an experimental treatment and recommends its use primarily within clinical trials, or, less commonly, through the special access program in rare, special circumstances.

        "Despite improvements in medical care, patients with advanced cancer still experience substantial symptom distress. There is increasing interest in the use of medicinal cannabinoids but little high-quality evidence to guide clinicians. This study aims to define the role of a 1:1 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) cannabinoid preparation in the management of symptom burden in patients with advanced cancer undergoing standard palliative care. One hundred fifty participants will be recruited from five sites within the Queensland Palliative Care Research Group (QPCRG) and randomly assigned to an active treatment or placebo group. This study is a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial of escalating doses of an oral 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation. It will compare efficacy and safety outcomes of a titrated dose (10 mg/10 mg/mL oral solution formulation, dose range 2.5 mg/2.5 mg-30 mg/30 mg/day) against placebo. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, using escalating doses of 1:1 THC/CBD or placebo, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief with tolerable side effects. This is then followed by a further 2-week assessment period on the stable dose determined in collaboration with clinicians. The primary objective is to assess the effect of escalating doses of a 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation against placebo on change in total symptom score, with secondary objectives including establishing a patient-determined effective dose, the change in total physical and emotional sores, global impression of change, anxiety and depression, opioid use, quality of life and adverse effects. This will be the first placebo-controlled clinical trial to rigorously evaluate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of 1:1 THC/CBD for symptom relief in advanced cancer patients. This study will allow the medical community to have some evidence to present to patients wishing to access cannabis for their symptoms caused by advanced malignancy. ACTRN, ACTRN12619000037101 .

        "Reports have indicated possible uses of ayahuasca for the treatment of conditions including depression, addictions, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and specific psychoneuroendocrine immune system pathologies. The article assesses potential ayahuasca and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) integration with contemporary healthcare. The review also seeks to provide a summary of selected literature regarding the mechanisms of action of DMT and ayahuasca; and assess to what extent the state of research can explain reports of unusual phenomenology. A narrative review. Compounds in ayahuasca have been found to bind to serotonergic receptors, glutaminergic receptors, sigma-1 receptors, trace amine-associated receptors, and modulate BDNF expression and the dopaminergic system. Subjective effects are associated with increased delta and theta oscillations in amygdala and hippocampal regions, decreased alpha wave activity in the default mode network, and stimulations of vision-related brain regions particularly in the visual association cortex. Both biological processes and field of consciousness models have been proposed to explain subjective effects of DMT and ayahuasca, however, the evidence supporting the proposed models is not sufficient to make confident conclusions. Ayahuasca plant medicine and DMT represent potentially novel treatment modalities. Further research is required to clarify the mechanisms of action and develop treatments which can be made available to the general public. Integration between healthcare research institutions and reputable practitioners in the Amazon is recommended. ",

        "Previous research has identified elevated rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms amongst ecstasy users; however, few studies have examined which factors increase the likelihood of experiencing such symptoms. The current study aimed to determine the relationship between ecstasy use and depressive/anxiety symptomatology after controlling for known environmental and genetic (polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene) risk factors for depression and anxiety disorders. Participants consisted of a community sample of 184 18-35-year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12 months. Participants completed an interview and questionnaires and provided a saliva sample. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. Timeline methods were used to collect information on lifetime and recent ecstasy use, as well as recent other drug use and life stress. Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview--Trauma List. Genomic DNA was extracted from participant saliva samples. Neither lifetime nor recent ecstasy use was associated with the severity of current mood symptoms, either alone or in combination with genetic risk factors. Rather, lifetime trauma, recent stressful life events, the frequency of tobacco use and recent polydrug use significantly predicted the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. These results highlight the need to consider the role of environmental factors when examining the relationship between ecstasy use and mood symptoms. Whether ecstasy exacerbates such symptoms in vulnerable individuals requires further investigation using prospective designs. ",

        "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor agonists have recently emerged as promising new treatment options for a variety of disorders. The recent success of these agonists, also known as psychedelics, like psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and addiction, has ushered in a renaissance in the way these compounds are perceived in the medical community and populace at large. One emerging therapeutic area that holds significant promise is their use as anti-inflammatory agents. Activation of 5-HT receptors produces potent anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of human inflammatory disorders at sub-behavioural levels. This review discusses the role of the 5-HT receptor in the inflammatory response, as well as highlight studies using the 5-HT agonist ()-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine [()-DOI] to treat inflammation in cellular and animal models. It also examines potential mechanisms by which 5-HT agonists produce their therapeutic effects. Overall, psychedelics regulate inflammatory pathways via novel mechanisms, and may represent a new and exciting treatment strategy for several inflammatory disorders. ",

        "Though there was initial interest in the use of psychedelic drugs for psychiatric treatment, bad outcomes and subsequent passage of the Substance Act of 1970, which placed psychedelic drugs in the Schedule I category, significantly limited potential progress. More recently, however, there has been renewal in interest and promise of psychedelic research. The purpose of this review is to highlight contemporary human studies on the use of select psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, LSD, MDMA and ayahuasca, in the treatment of various psychiatric illnesses, including but not limited to treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, end-of-life anxiety, and substance use disorders. The safety and efficacy as reported from human and animal studies will also be discussed. Accumulated research to date has suggested the potential for psychedelics to emerge as breakthrough therapies for psychiatric conditions refractory to conventional treatments. However, given the unique history and high potential for misuse with popular distribution, special care and considerations must be undertaken to safeguard their use as viable medical treatments rather than drugs of abuse.",

        "There has been increasing attention on cannabis use for medical purposes, but there is currently a lack of data on its epidemiology. To examine the epidemiology of self-reported cannabis use for medical purposes by (1) estimating its prevalence, (2) comparing gender and age differences, and (3) investigating what reasons they were used to manage. Participants included 27,169 respondents (aged 16-65) who completed Wave 1 of The International Cannabis Policy Study (ICPS) conducted across Canada and the USA in 2018 via online surveys. Cannabis policy conditions were \"US legal-recreational\" (legal for both recreational and medical uses), \"US legal-medical only\", \"US illegal\", and \"Canada-medical only\". The overall prevalence of self-reported ever cannabis use for medical purposes was 27%, with similar rates by sex and the highest prevalence in young adults. Prevalence was higher in US legal-recreational states (34%) than US illegal states (23%), US legal-medical only states (25%), and Canada (25%). The most common physical health reasons include use to manage pain (53%), sleep (46%), headaches/migraines (35%), appetite (22%), and nausea/vomiting (21%). For mental health reasons, the most common were for anxiety (52%), depression (40%), and PTSD/trauma (17%). There were 11% who reported using cannabis for managing other drug or alcohol use and 4% for psychosis. A substantial proportion of the North American population self-reported cannabis use for medical purposes for a variety of medical reasons, including those living in jurisdictions without legal markets. Further research is needed to understand the safety and efficacy of these forms of medical cannabis use. ",

        "Psilocybin is a serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in some mushroom species. Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for various conditions, including end-of-life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking and alcohol dependence, with promising preliminary results. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (six men, six women) with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin's effects. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797. Psilocybin's acute psychedelic effects typically became detectable 30-60 min after dosing, peaked 2-3 h after dosing, and subsided to negligible levels at least 6 h after dosing. Mean self-rated intensity (on a 0-1 scale) was 0*51 (SD 0*36) for the low-dose session and 0*75 (SD 0*27) for the high-dose session. Psilocybin was well tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients). Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference -11*8, 95% CI -9*15 to -14*35, p=0*002, Hedges' g=3*1) and 3 months (-9*2, 95% CI -5*69 to -12*71, p=0*003, Hedges' g=2) after high-dose treatment. Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also noted. This study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and motivates further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach.

        "Hallucinogenic substances or psychedelic drugs have been historically used by humans worldwide for centuries, and interest grows around them because of the therapeutic potential that they pose for mental disease. Virtual Reality (VR), has been highly developed and improved in the last decade, and it is also gaining importance due to their potential as therapeutic tools. In this article, the most recent and relevant information regarding the medical applications of both VR and psychedelics was highlighted, and diverse potential therapeutic uses were explored in hope to set the ground for further research on this topic. A systematic literature review using the PRISMA methods was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science, including only peer-reviewed clinical trials or case studies written in English, that address the use of psychedelics and/or VR for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and that measure the success of the therapies. A final selection of 23 manuscripts were used in this systematic review. VR showed security and significant efficacy in the management of special cases of phobias (social, motion pain and spiders), eating disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), gambling disorder, preoperative anxiety and schizophrenia. The hallucinogenic drugs evaluated exhibited positive effects in treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence and PTSD. More research is needed in order to test the effectiveness of these therapies (alone or together) in different mental illnesses and different populations. ",

        "Currently, ketamine is the only legal psychedelic medicine available to mental health providers for the treatment of emotional suffering. Over the past several years, ketamine has come into psychiatric use as an intervention for treatment resistant depression (TRD), administered intravenously without a psychotherapeutic component. In these settings, ketamine's psychedelic effects are viewed as undesirable \"side effects.\" In contrast, we believe ketamine can benefit patients with a wide variety of diagnoses when administered with psychotherapy and using its psychedelic properties without need for intravenous (IV) access. Its proven safety over decades of use makes it ideal for office and supervised at-home use. The unique experience that ketamine facilitates with its biological, experiential, and psychological impacts has been tailored to optimize office-based treatment evolving into a method that we call Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP). This article is the first to explore KAP within an analytical framework examining three distinct practices that use similar methods. Here, we present demographic and outcome data from 235 patients. Our findings suggest that KAP is an effective method for decreasing depression and anxiety in a private practice setting, especially for older patients and those with severe symptom burden.",

        "Although previous studies have examined anxiety and depression in ecstasy (+/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) users, it remains unclear whether symptoms are associated specifically with ecstasy or with polydrug use in general. We compared mean symptomatology and clinically significant symptoms in 45 ecstasy polydrug, 48 cannabis polydrug and 40 legal drug users, who completed standardised self-report anxiety and depression symptom measures. We further examined whether group differences were secondary to increased somatic symptom reporting, which may reflect acute/subacute drug effects. Anxiety and depression scores were higher in polydrug than legal drug users, with no difference between ecstasy and cannabis groups. There was no difference in numbers meeting criteria for clinically significant depression or 'moderate' or 'severe' anxiety, but the polydrug group contained more individuals reporting at least 'mild' anxiety symptoms than the legal drug control. Multivariate analyses indicated that anxiety alone was sufficient to discriminate groups. Polydrug users reported more somatic anxiety symptoms than legal drug users, but endorsed equivalent numbers of non-somatic symptoms. High prevalence psychiatric symptomatology in ecstasy polydrug users may be associated with polydrug rather than ecstasy use. Higher ratings in polydrug users appear to be secondary to increased somatic symptom reporting, suggesting possible impacts of drug effects on symptom endorsement.",

        "Psychedelics (serotonergic hallucinogens) are powerful psychoactive substances that alter perception and mood and affect numerous cognitive processes. They are generally considered physiologically safe and do not lead to dependence or addiction. Their origin predates written history, and they were employed by early cultures in many sociocultural and ritual contexts. After the virtually contemporaneous discovery of (5R,8R)-(+)-lysergic acid-N,N-diethylamide (LSD)-25 and the identification of serotonin in the brain, early research focused intensively on the possibility that LSD and other psychedelics had a serotonergic basis for their action. Today there is a consensus that psychedelics are agonists or partial agonists at brain serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors, with particular importance on those expressed on apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in layer V. Several useful rodent models have been developed over the years to help unravel the neurochemical correlates of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor activation in the brain, and a variety of imaging techniques have been employed to identify key brain areas that are directly affected by psychedelics. Recent and exciting developments in the field have occurred in clinical research, where several double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with cancer-related psychosocial distress have demonstrated unprecedented positive relief of anxiety and depression. Two small pilot studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy also have shown positive benefit in treating both alcohol and nicotine addiction. Recently, blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography have been employed for in vivo brain imaging in humans after administration of a psychedelic, and results indicate that intravenously administered psilocybin and LSD produce decreases in oscillatory power in areas of the brain's default mode network.",

        "Recent clinical trials suggest that psychedelic-assisted therapy is a promising intervention for reducing anxiety and depression and ameliorating existential despair in advanced cancer patients. However, little is known about perceptions toward this treatment from the key gatekeepers to this population. The current study aimed to understand the perceptions of cancer healthcare professionals about the potential use of psychedelic-assisted therapy in advanced cancer patients. Twelve cancer healthcare professionals including doctors, nurses, psychologists and social workers took part in a semi-structured interview which explored their awareness and perceptions toward psychedelic-assisted therapy with advanced cancer patients. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four inter-connected themes were identified. Two themes relate to the role and responsibility of being a cancer healthcare worker: (1) 'beneficence: a need to alleviate the suffering of cancer patients' and (2) 'non-maleficence: keeping vulnerable cancer patients safe', and two themes relate specifically to the potential for psychedelic-assisted therapy as (3) 'a transformative approach with the potential for real benefit' but that (4) 'new frontiers can be risky endeavours'. The findings from this study suggest intrigue and openness in cancer healthcare professionals to the idea of utilising psychedelic-assisted therapy with advanced cancer patients. Openness to the concept appeared to be driven by a lack of current effective treatment options and a desire to alleviate suffering. However, acceptance was tempered by concerns around safety and the importance of conducting rigorous, well-designed trials. The results from this study provide a useful basis for engaging with healthcare professionals about future research, trial design and potential clinical applications.",

        "After a two-decade hiatus in which research on psychedelics was essentially halted, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy for mental health conditions have begun to be published. We identified nine randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy published since 1994. Studies examined psilocybin, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), ayahuasca (which contains a combination of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and harmala monoamine oxidase inhibitor alkaloids), and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). We compared the standardized mean difference between the experimental and placebo control group at the primary endpoint. Results indicated a significant mean between-groups effect size of 1.21 (Hedges ), which is larger than the typical effect size found in trials of psychopharmacological or psychotherapy interventions. For the three studies that maintained a placebo control through a follow-up assessment, effects were generally maintained at follow-up. Overall, analyses support the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy across four mental health conditions - post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety/depression associated with a life-threatening illness, unipolar depression, and social anxiety among autistic adults. While study quality was high, we identify several areas for improvement regarding the conduct and reporting of trials. Larger trials with more diverse samples are needed to examine possible moderators and mediators of effects, and to establish whether effects are maintained over time. ",

        "To investigate whether variation may exist in betel nut- and ecstasy-involved adolescents in terms of sociobehavioral characteristics, the experience of psychoactive substance use, and behavioral/emotional problems. Students (n = 53,528) aged 12-18 sampled via stratified, multistage, random cluster sampling in 2004, 2005, and 2006 throughout Taiwan were categorized into four groups: betel nut- and ecstasy-naive (n = 51,009), betel nut use only (n = 1965), ecstasy use only (n = 196), and use of both (n = 152). Participants completed a questionnaire with information on sociodemographic features, substance-use experiences, and the Chinese adaptation of the Youth Self Report. Having a job, a larger weekly allowance, truancy, sexual experience, and externalizing behaviors were all in strong association with the involvement of either betel nut or ecstasy use. Compared with ecstasy-only users, betel nut-only users were more likely to be male, from the Eastern region of Taiwan, with initiation motivated by family members or friends, and having excess risks for Anxiety/Depression, Thought Problems, and Attention Problems. In contrast, ecstasy-only users were more likely to be female and involved in using other illegal drugs, with their initiation motivated by entertainment and with the drug use taking place in such settings. The variation in the experience of psychoactive substance use and behavioral problems for betel nut and ecstasy users suggests the existence of subgroups of drug-using adolescents in Taiwan. The identification of such heterogeneity may guide the efforts to reduce substance use and develop subgroup-tailored preventive programs. ",

        "Previous research has suggested that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) users have elevated depressive symptomatology, although it is not clear whether this is due to MDMA or other drug use. This study aimed to investigate the contributions of MDMA and cannabis use to Major Depressive Disorder in MDMA users. A total of 226 MDMA users were studied. Participants (65% male) reported an average number of 35.8 uses of MDMA (SD = 45.6, range = 2-400). Participants were administered a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Twenty-six individuals (11.5%) met lifetime criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. High rates of lifetime Cannabis Abuse (30.1%) and Cannabis Dependence (12.4%) were reported. No association was found between number of uses of MDMA and Major Depressive Disorder. Those with lifetime major depression were found, however, to have higher rates of lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 2.40). A logistic regression indicated that lifetime cannabis use disorder, but not MDMA use, was significantly associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Stratified analyses suggested that for males, neither drug use variable was associated with major depression. For females, a lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 4.99), but not MDMA use, was associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Results of this study suggest that although MDMA use was not found to be significantly associated with major depression for either gender, a lifetime cannabis use disorder was significantly associated with lifetime major depression for female, but not male, users of MDMA.",

        "Classic psychedelics, such as LSD, psilocybin, and the DMT-containing beverage ayahuasca, show some potential to treat depression, anxiety, and addiction. Importantly, clinical improvements can last for months or years after treatment. It has been theorized that these long-term improvements arise because psychedelics rapidly and lastingly stimulate neuroplasticity. The focus of this review is on answering specific questions about the effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity. Firstly, we review the evidence that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity and examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the effects of different psychedelics on different aspects of neuroplasticity, including dendritogenesis, synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and expression of plasticity-related genes (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor and immediate early genes). We then examine where in the brain psychedelics promote neuroplasticity, particularly discussing the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We also examine what doses are required to produce this effect (e.g., hallucinogenic doses vs. \"microdoses\"), and how long purported changes in neuroplasticity last. Finally, we discuss the likely consequences of psychedelics' effects on neuroplasticity for both patients and healthy people, and we identify important research questions that would further scientific understanding of psychedelics' effects on neuroplasticity and its potential clinical applications.",

        "It is a basic principle of the \"psychedelic\" treatment model that the quality of the acute experience mediates long-term improvements in mental health. In the present paper we sought to test this using data from a clinical trial assessing psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In line with previous reports, we hypothesized that the occurrence and magnitude of Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN) (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) (similar to anxiety) would predict long-term positive outcomes, whereas sensory perceptual effects would have negligible predictive value.  Twenty patients with treatment resistant depression underwent treatment with psilocybin (two separate sessions: 10 and 25 mg psilocybin). The Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire was used to assess the quality of experiences in the 25 mg psilocybin session. From the ASC, the dimensions OBN and DED were used to measure the mystical-type and challenging experiences, respectively. The Self-Reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR) at 5 weeks served as the endpoint clinical outcome measure, as in later time points some of the subjects had gone on to receive new treatments, thus confounding inferences. In a repeated measure ANOVA, Time was the within-subject factor (independent variable), with QIDS-SR as the within-subject dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week, 5-weeks. OBN and DED were independent variables. OBN-by-Time and DED-by-Time interactions were the primary outcomes of interest.  For the interaction of OBN and DED with Time (QIDS-SR as dependent variable), the main effect and the effects at each time point compared to baseline were all significant ( = 0.002 and  = 0.003, respectively, for main effects), confirming our main hypothesis. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation of OBN with QIDS-SR (5 weeks) was specific compared to perceptual dimensions of the ASC ( < 0.05).  This report further bolsters the view that the quality of the acute psychedelic experience is a key mediator of long-term changes in mental health. Future therapeutic work with psychedelics should recognize the essential importance of  in determining treatment efficacy and consider ways of enhancing mystical-type experiences and reducing anxiety.

        "Psilocybin is an emerging potential therapy for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses. Microdosing has been shown to result in an overall improvement in patients with anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse. This meta-analysis explores and compiles prior research to make further inferences regarding psilocybin and its use for the treatment of psychiatric illness along with its safety and efficacy. Database searches were conducted to identify peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials and clinical trials mentioning psilocybin use and psychiatric illness. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram was created and analysis was run on the nine articles that met all established inclusion criteria. An event is defined as a participant who showed improvement, in a quantitative method, from baseline after the use of psilocybin. Another analysis was done using depression severity (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 16-Item Self Report, QIDS-SR16) at baseline and after the use of psilocybin. Analyses of the original data and the nine articles showed a great deal of heterogeneity with an I value of 73.68%, suggesting that the studies in this meta-analysis cannot be considered to be studies of the same population. The Q value of 30.4 was higher than 15.507, which is the critical value for eight degrees of freedom found in a chi-square distribution. This Q value showed a high degree of variation and lacked significance. The second meta-run on QIDS-SR16 scores from three studies showed a Q value of 1.16 which was lower than 5.991, the critical value for two degrees of freedom found in a chi-square distribution. The I statistic for this second meta-analysis was -73% which can be equated to zero. This indicated that the data were homogeneous or that there was no observed heterogeneity. Due to low heterogeneity, the fixed-effects model was used. Based on this meta-analysis, psilocybin seems to show symptom improvement in some psychiatric illnesses. The effectiveness of psilocybin microdosing and the use of psilocybin, in general, need to be studied further to determine the efficacy and safety of potential applications in psychiatry. ",

        "Stimulation of serotonergic neurotransmission by psilocybin has been shown to shift emotional biases away from negative towards positive stimuli. We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing. However, it is still not known whether psilocybin modulates bottom-up or top-down connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network underlying threat processing. We therefore analyzed our previous fMRI data using dynamic causal modeling and used Bayesian model selection to infer how psilocybin modulated effective connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network during threat processing. First, both placebo and psilocybin data were best explained by a model in which threat affect modulated bidirectional connections between the primary visual cortex, amygdala, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Second, psilocybin decreased the threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the amygdala to primary visual cortex, speaking to a neural mechanism that might underlie putative shifts towards positive affect states after psilocybin administration. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.",

        "Antiretroviral drugs are the mainstay of treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Lifelong highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is indicated to prevent disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Efavirenz was a first-line component of HAART across the world for many years. The purpose of this article is to review the psychotropic properties of efavirenz, which are the most important adverse events associated with the drug and commonly result in treatment discontinuation. A PubMed search was conducted using efavirenz as a search term, which returned 4655 results. Titles and abstracts of articles were screened for relevance, and all relevant articles published in English were included in the narrative review. Acute exposure to efavirenz may cause profound perceptual disturbances (delusions and hallucinations) whereas chronic exposure may be associated with abnormal dreams and other sleep disturbances, anxiety, depressed mood and suicidality. It may also be abused as a hallucinogen, especially in individuals with a history of poly-substance abuse. Recent research indicates that efavirenz directly affects monoaminergic neurotransmission and may partially substitute for psychedelic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Efavirenz acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, a serotonin-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor, which are mechanisms common with many psychotropic drugs. Efavirenz interacts with many of the same molecular targets as the empathogen methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), but the effects of the 2 drugs may differ. The exact mechanism of action of efavirenz as a psychotropic drug remains unclear and future studies should focus on evaluating whether prolonged exposure could lead to irreversible side effects. ",

        "There is increasing evidence that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade in the neonatal period has a long-lasting influence on brain and behavior development and has been linked to an increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders in later life. We sought to determine whether postnatal NMDA receptor blockade can affect normal development of body weight, corticosterone levels, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in male and female mice in adulthood. For this purpose, male and female NMRI mice were treated with either saline or phencyclidine (PCP; 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) on postnatal days (PND) 7, 9, and 11, and then subjected to different behavioral tests, including open field, elevated plus-maze, elevated zero-maze, light-dark box, tail suspension test and forced swimming test in adulthood. The results indicated that neonatal PCP treatment reduced body weight during neonatal and adulthood periods, and did not alter baseline corticosterone levels in both male and female mice. Moreover, this study obtained some experimental evidence showing the PCP at dose of 10 mg/kg increases stress-induced corticosterone levels, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in males, while decreasing levels of anxiety without any significant effect on depression in female mice in adulthood. These data support the argument that neonatal NMDA receptor blockade can lead to behavioral abnormalities and psychiatric diseases in adulthood. Collectively, our findings suggest that neonatal exposure to PCP may have profound effects on the development of anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in a sex- and dose-dependent manner in mice.",

        "Ayahuasca (AYA), a natural psychedelic brew prepared from Amazonian plants and rich in dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and harmine, causes effects of subjective well-being and may therefore have antidepressant actions. This study sought to evaluate the effects of a single dose of AYA in six volunteers with a current depressive episode. Open-label trial conducted in an inpatient psychiatric unit. Statistically significant reductions of up to 82% in depressive scores were observed between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after AYA administration, as measured on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Anxious-Depression subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). AYA administration resulted in nonsignificant changes in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores and in the thinking disorder subscale of the BPRS, suggesting that AYA does not induce episodes of mania and/or hypomania in patients with mood disorders and that modifications in thought content, which could indicate psychedelic effects, are not essential for mood improvement. These results suggest that AYA has fast-acting anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in patients with a depressive disorder. ",

        "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was studied from the 1950s to the 1970s to evaluate behavioral and personality changes, as well as remission of psychiatric symptoms in various disorders. LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included. Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567 patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in the future.",

        "LSD is an ambiguous substance, said to mimic psychosis and to improve mental health in people suffering from anxiety and depression. Little is known about the neuronal correlates of altered states of consciousness induced by this substance. Limited previous studies indicated profound changes in functional connectivity of resting state networks after the administration of LSD. The current investigation attempts to replicate and extend those findings in an independent sample. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, 100 mg LSD and placebo were orally administered to 20 healthy participants. Resting state brain activity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. -network and -network connectivity measures of ten established resting state networks were compared between drug conditions. Complementary analysis were conducted using resting state networks as sources in seed-to-voxel analyses. Acute LSD administration significantly decreased functional connectivity  visual, sensorimotor and auditory networks and the default mode network. While -network connectivity was widely increased and all investigated networks were affected to some extent, seed-to-voxel analyses consistently indicated increased connectivity between networks and subcortical (thalamus, striatum) and cortical (precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex) hub structures. These latter observations are consistent with findings on the importance of hubs in psychopathological states, especially in psychosis, and could underlay therapeutic effects of hallucinogens as proposed by a recent model.

        "Moderate to severe spasticity is commonly reported in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its management is still a challenge. Cannabinoids were recently suggested as add-on therapy for the treatment of spasticity and chronic pain in MS but there is no conclusive scientific evidence on their safety, especially on cognition and over long periods. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to assess the long-term effects of a tetrahydrocannabinol-cannabidiol (THC/CBD) oromucosal spray (Sativex(r)) on cognition, mood and anxiety. An extensive and specific battery of neuropsychological tests (Symbol Digit Modalities Test-SDMT, California Verbal Learning Test-CVLT, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-BVMT; PASAT-3 and 2; Free and Cued Selective Remind Test-FCSRT, Index of Sensitivity of Cueing-ISC) was applied to longitudinally investigate different domains of cognition in 20 consecutive MS patients receiving Sativex for spasticity. The primary endpoint was to assess any variation in cognitive performance. Secondary outcomes regarding mood and anxiety were investigated by means of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Any change in patients' spasticity was evaluated using the 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Twenty per protocol patients were followed up and evaluated at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Domains involving processing speed and auditory verbal memory significantly improved within the first 6 months of therapy (SDMT: p < 0.001; CVLT: p = 0.0001). Mood and anxiety did not show any significant variation. Additionally, the NRS score significantly improved since the beginning (p < 0.0001). These results are encouraging in supporting possible long-term benefits of Sativex on cognition and a wider role than symptom alleviator. Further studies on larger groups of patients would be necessary in order to test this intriguing possibility. ",

        "To investigate pathways to ecstasy use disorders from pre-birth to early adulthood with particular attention to the relationship between early depressive and anxiety symptoms and later ecstasy use disorders. Prospective, longitudinal, population-based study started in Brisbane, South East Queensland (Australia) in 1981. Participants were 2143 young adults, followed up from pre-birth to young adulthood. Ecstasy use disorders were assessed with the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI-Auto). Maternal socio-economic position and mental health status were assessed at baseline (antenatal visit); maternal substance use was measured at the 5-year follow-up, adolescents' behaviour at the 5- and 14-year follow-up and tobacco and alcohol use were assessed at the 14-year follow-up. Eight syndrome scales of childhood behaviour were examined. After adjustment for important confounders, delinquent and aggressive behaviour in early adolescence remained significantly associated with ecstasy use disorders in early adulthood. The associations became statistically non-significant when adolescent tobacco and alcohol use were included in the model [OR=1.50 (95%CI=0.75, 3.01) for delinquency and OR=1.69 (95%CI=0.92, 3.12) for aggression]. Formal mediation tests were statistically significant (p=0.001 for delinquent behaviour and p=0.05 for aggressive behaviour). Our findings suggest a pathway from early deviant behaviour to ecstasy use disorders, possibly mediated through licit drug experimentation in early adolescence. ",

        "Animal models of anxiety such as the four-plates test (FPT) enable the detection of an anxiolytic effect not only of benzodiazepines (BZDs) but also of other non-BZD anxiolytic compounds such as the antidepressants paroxetine and venlafaxine. Retesting mice in animal models of anxiety markedly alters the behavioural profile of various drugs. The aim of this study was first to investigate the function of GABA(A)/BZD receptor and passive avoidance acquisition in the FPT \"test-retest\". The second aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of the FPT to discriminate BZDs from other non-BZD anxiolytics in experienced mice. The FPT was performed in naive and experienced mice (submitted to the test 24 h previously). The drugs studied were two BZDs, diazepam (1 mg/kg) and alprazolam (0.25 mg/kg); flumazenil, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist (8 mg/kg); atropine sulphate, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (4 mg/kg) known for its amnesic properties; paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (4 and 8 mg/kg); venlafaxine, a serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor (4 and 16 mg/kg); and DOI, a 5-HT2A agonist (1 mg/kg). Our results reveal an increase of anxiety (decrease of punished passages) in saline-experienced mice. Diazepam, alprazolam, paroxetine and venlafaxine did not prevent the increase in anxiety during retest, revealing a passive avoidance acquisition. Flumazenil did not modify the anxiogenic-like behaviour of experienced mice. In contrast, atropine seems to oppose the increase of anxiety; however, its effect is weak and disputable. DOI was the only anxiolytic compound able to oppose the decrease of punished passages of experienced mice. Anxiogenic behaviour on retesting indicates aversive learning. The protocol test-retest is unable to discriminate between the anxiolytic effect of BZDs from that of paroxetine or venlafaxine. However, this modified model may constitute a new tool to investigate other neural pathways implicated in anxiety. ",

        "Despite the recent discovery of the potential mechanisms underlying the analgesic effects of cannabis, few clinical studies have so far assessed its analgesic effects, notably in the treatment of chronic non-malignant pain. All the studies used administration of cannabis alone. The aim of this open, pilot, study was to assess the efficacy and side effect profile of oral dronabinol (tetrahydrocannabinol - THC) in the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain. Seven patients (3 women/4 men), aged 60 +/- 14 years, suffering from chronic refractory neuropathic pain, received oral THC titrated to the maximum dose of 25 mg/day (mean dose: 15 +/- 6 mg), during an average of 55,4 days (range: 13-128). Various components of pain (continuous, paroxysmal and brush-induced allodynia) were assessed using VAS scores. Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) was evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale was used to measure depression and anxiety. THC did not induce significant effect on the various pain, HRQL and anxiety and depression scores. Numerous side effects (notably sedation and asthenia) were observed in 5 patients out of 7, requiring premature discontinuation of the drug in 3 patients. The present study did not reveal any significant efficacy of THC in a small cohort of patients with chronic refractory neuropathic pain, but underlined the unfavorable side effect profile of the drug. These results may partly relate to the fact that oral dronabinol exhibits a poor therapeutic ratio (efficacy at the price of side effects). The development of new and better tolerated cannabinoids is warranted. ",

        "The authors provide an evidenced-based summary of the literature on the clinical application of psychedelic drugs in psychiatric disorders. Searches of PubMed and PsycINFO via Ovid were conducted for articles in English, in peer-reviewed journals, reporting on \"psilocybin,\" \"lysergic acid diethylamide,\" \"LSD,\" \"ayahuasca,\" \"-methylenedioxymethamphetamine,\" and \"MDMA,\" in human subjects, published between 2007 and July 1, 2019. A total of 1,603 articles were identified and screened. Articles that did not contain the terms \"clinical trial,\" \"therapy,\" or \"imaging\" in the title or abstract were filtered out. The 161 remaining articles were reviewed by two or more authors. The authors identified 14 articles reporting on well-designed clinical trials investigating the efficacy of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin, and ayahuasca for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, trauma and stress-related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders as well as in end-of-life care. The most significant database exists for MDMA and psilocybin, which have been designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as \"breakthrough therapies\" for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and treatment-resistant depression, respectively. The research on LSD and ayahuasca is observational, but available evidence suggests that these agents may have therapeutic effects in specific psychiatric disorders. Randomized clinical trials support the efficacy of MDMA in the treatment of PTSD and psilocybin in the treatment of depression and cancer-related anxiety. The research to support the use of LSD and ayahuasca in the treatment of psychiatric disorders is preliminary, although promising. Overall, the database is insufficient for FDA approval of any psychedelic compound for routine clinical use in psychiatric disorders at this time, but continued research on the efficacy of psychedelics for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is warranted.

        "That cannabis use may provoke mental disturbances is well known to Scandinavian psychiatrists today. A review of the psychiatric aspects of cannabis use is given, and the clinical signs of 70 cases of cannabis psychoses collected in Sweden are described. The bluntness and \"amotivation\" following chronic cannabis use are discussed. Anxiety reactions, flashbacks, dysphoric reactions and an abstinence syndrome are all sequels of cannabis use. Three risk groups begin to emerge: a) Young teenage cannabis users who lose some of their capacity to learn complex functions and who flee from reality to a world of dreams. With its sedative effect, cannabis could modify such emotions as anger and anxiety and slow down the liberation process of adolescence. b) Heavy daily users, often persons who cannot cope with depression or their life circumstances. c) Psychiatric patients whose resistance to relapses into psychotic reactions might be diminished according to the psychotropic effects of cannabis.",

        "Psychedelic drugs have long been known to be capable of inducing mystical or transcendental experiences. However, given the common \"recreational\" nature of much present-day psychedelic use, with typical doses tending to be lower than those commonly taken in the 1960s, the extent to which illicit use of psychedelics today is associated with mystical experiences is not known. Furthermore the mild psychedelic MDMA (\"Ecstasy\") is more popular today than \"full\" psychedelics such as LSD or psilocybin, and the contribution of illicit MDMA use to mystical experiences is not known. The present study recruited 337 adults from the website and newsletter of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), most of whom reported use of a variety of drugs both licit and illicit including psychedelics. Although only a quarter of the sample reported \"spiritual\" motives for using psychedelics, use of LSD and psilocybin was significantly positively related to scores on two well-known indices of mystical experiences in a dose-related manner, whereas use of MDMA, cannabis, cocaine, opiates and alcohol was not. Results suggest that even in today's context of \"recreational\" drug use, psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin, when taken at higher doses, continue to induce mystical experiences in many users.",

        "This report concerns two schizophrenic patients who had ingested a biperiden overdose between 8 and 14 mg per day. This drug had been prescribed to treat extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptics. Once the ingestion was suppressed, both patients complained about anxiety, discomfort and depression. These symptoms disappeared when reintroducing the biperiden. Both patients had a previous record of alcohol and cannabis abuse. One of them had also a recorder of sporadic consumption of other drugs such as heroin, amphetamines and hallucinogens. The predominant psychopathology was of the negative type. Through these cases we intend to support the likelihood of a cholinergic hyperactivity in the negative schizophrenic symptoms.",

        "Microdosing is the practice of regularly using low doses of psychedelic drugs. Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing enhances well-being and cognition; however, such accounts are potentially biased by the placebo effect. This study used a 'self-blinding' citizen science initiative, where participants were given online instructions on how to incorporate placebo control into their microdosing routine without clinical supervision. The study was completed by 191 participants, making it the largest placebo-controlled trial on psychedelics to-date. All psychological outcomes improved significantly from baseline to after the 4 weeks long dose period for the microdose group; however, the placebo group also improved and no significant between-groups differences were observed. Acute (emotional state, drug intensity, mood, energy, and creativity) and post-acute (anxiety) scales showed small, but significant microdose vs. placebo differences; however, these results can be explained by participants breaking blind. The findings suggest that anecdotal benefits of microdosing can be explained by the placebo effect.",

        "While clinical studies have established a link between aggression and ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymeth-amphetamine [MDMA]), no research has attempted to explore how this link manifests itself in behavioral outcomes. In this research we examine the effects of ecstasy on aggressive and violent behavior in a sample of active users. Data were collected from 260 ecstasy users in Atlanta, Georgia. Data analysis included ordered logit regression to examine the likelihood of engaging in aggressive behavior, controlling for key predictors of aggression independent of ecstasy use. Our results indicate that those with a higher prevalence of lifetime ecstasy use exhibit higher levels of aggressive and violent behavior. However, the effect of lifetime ecstasy use differs by levels of low self-control as a measure of propensity for aggression. Those who exhibit low self-control are more affected by ecstasy use than those who do not in terms of aggression. Our findings add an important dimension to our current knowledge about the relationship between aggression and ecstasy.",

        "Self-administration of very low doses of psychedelic drugs to improve mental health and wellbeing and enhance cognitive function, known as microdosing, has received recent media attention, but little research has been conducted. We conducted a content analysis of discussions about microdosing from the online forum Reddit. We examined motivations, dosing practices, and perceived benefits and limitations of microdosing. Motivations included self-management of mental health issues, improvement of psychosocial wellbeing, and cognitive enhancement. Self-reported benefits included cognitive and creative enhancement, reduced depression and anxiety, enhanced self-insight and mindfulness, improved mood and attitude toward life, improved habits and health behaviors, and improved social interactions and interpersonal connections. Perceived limitations included issues related to dosing, adverse physical effects, taking illegal substances, limited or no mental health or cognitive improvement, increased anxiety, unpleasant \"off\" days, only short-term benefits, and concerns about dependence and drug-related risks. Standard doses of psychedelic drugs provided in therapeutic settings have potential as novel treatments for some mental health conditions, but clinical research is needed to understand if this is also the case for microdosing. In the meantime, harm reduction resources should be developed and made available to provide the best available information on the safer use of self-administered psychedelics.",

        "The substituted amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') and methamphetamine (METH, 'ice', 'speed') are increasingly popular drugs amongst party-drug users. Studies with humans have investigated the acute and possible long-term adverse effects of these drugs, yet outcomes of such studies are often ambiguous due to a variety of confounding factors. Studies employing animal models have value in determining the acute and long-term effects of MDMA and METH on brain and behaviour. Self-administration studies show that intravenous METH is a particularly potent reinforcer in rats and other species. In contrast, MDMA appears to have powerful effects in enhancing social behaviour in laboratory animals. Brief exposure to MDMA or METH may produce long-term reductions in dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain and alterations in the density of various receptor and transporter proteins. However it is still unclear, particularly in the case of MDMA, whether this reflects a 'neurotoxic' effect of the drug. Lasting alterations in social behaviour, anxiety, depressive symptoms and memory have been demonstrated in laboratory rats given MDMA or METH and this matches long-term changes reported in some human studies. Recent laboratory studies suggest that MDMA/METH combinations may produce greater adverse neurochemical and behavioural effects than either drug alone. This is of some concern given recent evidence that party drug users may be frequently exposed to this combination of drugs.",

        "We reviewed the literature on the psychological aspects of MDMA consumption. The present paper examined the characteristics, psychological and psychopathological consequences of synthetic drug use (MDMA). The most frequent features are depression, anxiety, cognitive disorders and sensation seeking. Longer-term, higher dosage, and use of other substances are correlated with higher risk of developing psychopathological disorders. Care should be taken in cross-sectional studies in interpreting signs and symptoms of mental disorder merely as a consequence of MDMA use, because the use of ecstasy may be associated with use of multiple substances from which the mental disorder might be more likely to precede. The consumption pattern of ecstasy and related substances must be carefully analyzed. Knowledge of the MDMA consumption profile is an important for understanding the psychological characteristics of synthetic drug users.",

        "Despite promising results from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, the efficacy of r-TMS as a treatment for OCD remains controversial, at least in part owing to inconsistency in the trial methodologies and heterogeneity in the trial outcomes. This meta-analysis attempts to explain some of this heterogeneity by comparing the efficacy of r-TMS in patients with or without resistance to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), defined using standardized criteria. We conducted a pre-registered (PROSPERO ID: 241381) systematic review and meta-analysis. English language articles reporting blinded RCTs were retrieved from searches using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies were subjected to subgroup analysis based on four stages of treatment resistance, defined using an adaptation of published criteria (1 = not treatment resistant, 2 = one SSRI trial failed, 3 = two SSRI trials failed, 4 = two SSRI trials failed plus one or more CBT trial failed). Meta-regression analyses investigated patient and methodological factors (age, duration of OCD, illness severity, stage of treatment-resistance, or researcher allegiance) as possible moderators of effect size. Twenty-five independent comparisons (23 studies) were included. Overall, r-TMS showed a medium-sized reduction of Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores (Hedge's g: -0.47; 95%CI: - 0.67 to -0.27) with moderate heterogeneity (I = 39.8%). Assessment of publication bias using Trim and Fill analysis suggested a reduced effect size that remained significant (g: -0.29; 95%CI: -0.51 to -0.07). Subgroup analysis found that those studies including patients non-resistant to SSRI (stage 1) (g: -0.65; 95%CI: -1.05 to -0.25, k = 7) or with low SSRI-resistance (stage 2) (g:-0.47; 95%CI: -0.86 to -0.09, k = 6) produced statistically significant results with low heterogeneity, while studies including more highly resistant patients at stage 3 (g: -0.39; 95%CI: -0.90 to 0.11, k = 4) and stage 4 (g: -0.36; 95%CI: -0.75 to 0.03, k = 8) did not. Intriguingly, the only significant moderator of the effect size found by meta-regression was the severity of baseline depressive symptoms. All trials showed evidence of researcher allegiance in favour of the intervention and therefore caution is required in interpreting the reported effect sizes. This meta-analysis shows that r-TMS is an effective treatment for OCD, but largely for those not resistant to SSRI or failing to respond to only one SSRI trial. As a consequence, r-TMS may be best implemented earlier in the care pathway. These findings would have major implications for clinical service development, but further well-powered RCTs, which eliminate bias from researcher allegiance, are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

        "Cannabis products containing delta-8-THC became widely available in most of the United States in late 2020 and rapidly became a significant source of revenue for hemp processing companies, especially in states where use of delta-9-THC remains illegal or requires professional authorization for medical use. Scientific research on the use of delta-8-THC is scarce, previous clinical studies included a combined total of 14 participants, leading some state governments to prohibit it until its properties and effects are better understood.  Researchers developed an online survey for delta-8-THC consumers addressing a broad range of issues regarding delta-8-THC, including use for the treatment of health and medical conditions. Previous survey studies on the medical use of cannabis and cannabis products informed survey components.  Patterns of delta-8-THC use had both similarities with and differences from the use of delta-9-THC cannabis and products. Administration methods were primarily edibles (64%) and vaping concentrates (48%). About half of the participants (51%) used delta-8-THC to treat a range of health and medical conditions, primarily anxiety or panic attacks (69%), stress (52%), depression or bipolar disorder (46%), and chronic pain (41%). Participants compared delta-8-THC very favorably with both delta-9-THC and pharmaceutical drugs and reported substantial levels of substitution for both. Most participants did not inform their primary care provider of their delta-8-THC use (78%) and were not confident of their primary care provider's ability to integrate medical cannabis into their treatment (70%). Knowledge of effective dosages was low, and participants' knowledge of delta-8-THC was primarily from the Internet and their own experiences.  Harm reduction is a central component of public health. Although the legal environment is becoming more restrictive for delta-8-THC in comparison to delta-9-THC, results suggest that delta-8-THC may be equally effective for desired purposes of cannabis use and lower in undesirable or adverse effects. All policies and practices should be informed by empirical evidence. Considerable research will be needed to systematically verify the patterns reported by participants, and collaborations among academic researchers, government, and the cannabis industry may be valuable in developing the knowledge base for delta-8-THC and other cannabinoids.

        "Animal experiments suggest that endogenous substances that could result from the interaction between neurotransmitters (dopamine and indoleamines) and ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde might be involved in the pathogenesis and maintenance of alcohol dependence. Therefore, aromatic beta-carbolines (norharman and harman) were investigated repeatedly in 24-hr urine of 13 male severe alcoholics without any psychiatric comorbidity during a controlled inpatient abstention program of up to 8 weeks. Harman excretion was approximately 2-fold above levels in control subjects, with a steady decline after 3 weeks of abstinence and lower levels in patients with a longer duration of alcohol dependence. Severity of withdrawal symptoms and actual feelings of anxiety/depression were negatively associated with urinary harman excretion. Positive associations could be established with daily ethanol consumption the month before admission and the score on the scale \"reward dependence\" according to Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Moreover, patients without alcohol-dependent first-degree relatives and higher \"reward dependence\" exhibited an increased excretion of harman. Therefore, harman levels might characterize a distinct subgroup of alcoholic patients, who in part resemble the so-called type l alcoholics of Cloninger. However, this awaits further study in a larger number of individuals. In contrast, norharman excretion was elevated up to 6-fold, compared with nonalcoholics over 6 to 8 weeks of controlled abstention. No correlations to demographic or clinical variables could be observed. Therefore, increased norharman levels might be proposed as a \"residual marker\" or a trait variable. Whether the observed changes are specific markers of at least certain aspects of alcoholism or dependence remain to be elucidated.",

        "Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has a long duration of action. Studies have shown that effects on some behavioral endpoints can persist for as long as 24 h after exposure, but the neural substrates underlying these long-lasting effects have not yet been determined. The purpose of the present study was to identify the neuroanatomical substrates associated with the temporal course of the effects of the acute administration of moderate to high doses of THC using the quantitative autoradiographic 2-[(14)C]deoxyglucose (2DG) method. Male Sprague-Dawley rats ( n=4-5 per group) were administered THC (0.0, 2.5 or 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and the 2DG procedure was initiated 15 min, 6 h, or 24 h after treatment. To establish the behavioral profile of THC administration, locomotor activity and core body temperature were measured at corresponding time points. The administration of THC produced widespread dose-dependent reductions in rates of cerebral metabolism when the 2DG method was applied 15 min after treatment. A more limited set of structures was affected when the 2DG method was applied 6 h after THC administration, closely paralleling the effects of THC on locomotor activity and core body temperature. However, 24 h after administration, glucose utilization remained depressed within mesolimbic and amygdalar regions. These data demonstrate that the functional consequences of acute administration of THC follow a distinct temporal course that is regionally specific. That functional activity remains depressed in areas involved in the processing of motivational and emotional information suggests that behaviors subserved by these structures (e.g. anxiety, stress, and reward) may remain altered for as long as 24 h after a single exposure to THC.

        "This case report describes a 39-year-old male with remote history of polysubstance use disorder and depression who developed tinnitus after use of inhaled N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Although development of ear ringing was attributed to use on a single occasion, tinnitus occurred within the context of a larger self-experiment involving weekly microdoses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Distress and anxiety over the ear ringing prompted evaluation by an audiologist, primary care physician, and consultant psychopharmacologist. Tinnitus persisted for several months, although intensity and ability to cope with symptoms improved over time. A microdose of psilocybin mushrooms exacerbated tinnitus on two separate occasions, after which psychedelics were discontinued. Psychedelics are associated with a range of acute sensory changes including auditory phenomenon, although have not previously been associated with tinnitus in medical literature. Here, we present a probable case of tinnitus associated with DMT use and review potential underlying mechanisms connecting psychedelics and tinnitus.",

Areas covered: The \"search for studies\" tool using clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed were employed. The term, \"fibromyalgia\" was used for clinicaltrials.gov. The terms employed for PubMed were \"Name-of-Drug Fibromyalgia\", \"Fibromyalgia Treatment\" or \"Fibromyalgia Drug Treatment.\" Clinical trials were reviewed if they were prospective and blinded, and if they employed a comparator, either placebo or another pharmaceutical. Expert commentary: Progress toward standardizing the outcome measures for FMS clinical trials have been made but challenges remain. Several pharmaceutical candidates for FMS have been tested since 2009. The results of these studies with potential novel targets for drug development for FMS were reviewed including the results of trials with sodium oxybate, quetiapine, esreboxetine, nabilone, memantine, naltrexone, and melatonin.",

        "Depression and anxiety are common health problems affecting women, particularly during the reproductive years. Major depression is two to three times as common in women than in men. Neuroendocrine factors are likely to contribute to this overall increased risk for developing mood disorders in women, and the neuroendocrine influence is most obviously seen in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as these women experience depressed mood and anxiety premenstrually only during ovulatory cycles. Moreover, dysfunction of serotonergic transmission has been regarded as an important mechanism in several psychiatric disorders and ovarian steroids have been shown to profoundly influence the activity of the serotonergic system. Given these facts, the purpose of this study was to examine whether binding of [3H]paroxetine to the platelet serotonin transporter or binding of [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide ([3H]LSD) to the platelet 5-HT2A receptor are influenced by the cyclical changes in circulating estradiol and progesterone that occur during the menstrual cycle. We examined 28 healthy women, without oral contraceptives and with regular menstrual cycles. In the late follicular phase, Bmax for [3H]paroxetine binding was significantly higher than in the ovulatory (p<0.01), early luteal phase (p<0.05) and mid-luteal phase (p<0.01). Bmax for [3H]LSD binding was significantly higher in the early follicular phase and the early luteal phase compared to the mid-luteal phase (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). In the early follicular phase and the ovulatory phase, significant correlations between estradiol serum concentrations and Kd for [3H]paroxetine were obtained (p<0.001, respectively). In the luteal phase, significant inverse correlations between progesterone as well as estradiol serum concentrations and Kd for [3H]LSD binding were found (p<0.05, respectively).",

This open label prospective study investigated the safety, tolerability and analgesic benefit of oral Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) titrated to a maximal dosage of 25 mg/day in 8 consecutive patients with chronic refractory neuropathic pain. Spontaneous ongoing and paroxysmal pain, allodynia and paresthesias were assessed. The sensory and affective components of pain using the McGill pain questionnaire, quality of life, mood, anxiety and functionality were also evaluated. Seven patients suffered from side effects necessitating premature arrest of the drug in 5 of them. THC (mean dosage: 16.6+/-6.5 mg/day) did not induce any significant effects on ongoing and paroxysmal pain, allodynia, quality of life, anxiety/depression scores and functional impact of pain. These results do not support an overall benefit of THC in pain and quality of life in patients with refractory neuropathic pain.",

        "Subjective responses to psychoactive drugs have served as intriguing windows into consciousness as well as useful predictors. Subjective reactions to psychedelic molecules are particularly interesting given how they covary with subsequent improvements associated with psychedelic-assisted treatments. Although links between subjective reactions and decreases in treatment-resistant clinical depression, end-of-life anxiety, and maladaptive consumption of alcohol and nicotine appear in the empirical literature, the measurement of these subjective responses has proven difficult. Several scales developed over many decades show reasonable internal consistency. Studies suggest that many have a replicable factor structure and other good psychometric properties, but samples are often small and self-selected. We review the psychometric properties of some of the most widely used scales and detail their links to improvement in response to psychedelic-assisted treatments. Generally, assessments of mystical experiences or oceanic boundlessness correlate with improvements. Challenging subjective experiences, psychological insight, and emotional breakthroughs also show considerable promise, though replication would strengthen conclusions. We suggest a collaborative approach where investigators can focus on key responses to ensure that the field will eventually have data from many participants who report their subjective reactions to psychedelic molecules in a therapeutic setting. This may aid in predicting improvement amongst targeted conditions and wellbeing.",

        "Acute adverse psychological reactions to classic hallucinogens (\"bad trips\" or \"challenging experiences\"), while usually benign with proper screening, preparation, and support in controlled settings, remain a safety concern in uncontrolled settings (such as illicit use contexts). Anecdotal and case reports suggest potential adverse acute symptoms including affective (panic, depressed mood), cognitive (confusion, feelings of losing sanity), and somatic (nausea, heart palpitation) symptoms. Responses to items from several hallucinogen-sensitive questionnaires (Hallucinogen Rating Scale, the States of Consciousness Questionnaire, and the Five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire) in an Internet survey of challenging experiences with the classic hallucinogen psilocybin were used to construct and validate a Challenging Experience Questionnaire. The stand-alone Challenging Experience Questionnaire was then validated in a separate sample. Seven Challenging Experience Questionnaire factors (grief, fear, death, insanity, isolation, physical distress, and paranoia) provide a phenomenological profile of challenging aspects of experiences with psilocybin. Factor scores were associated with difficulty, meaningfulness, spiritual significance, and change in well-being attributed to the challenging experiences. The factor structure did not differ based on gender or prior struggle with anxiety or depression. The Challenging Experience Questionnaire provides a basis for future investigation of predictors and outcomes of challenging experiences with classic hallucinogens.",

        "Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic/psychedelic traditionally used for ritual and therapeutic purposes. One such therapeutic use is related to Substance Use Disorders (SUDs). A previous systematic review of preclinical and human studies published until 2016 suggested that ayahuasca and its alkaloids have therapeutic effects in the treatment of SUDs. To conduct an update of this previous review. A systematic review of quantitative studies which analyzed the effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids on drug use (primary outcome) and other measures (secondary outcomes) related to SUDs was conducted, including articles from 2016 to 2020. Nine studies (four preclinical, five observational) were included in the review. Preclinical studies in rodents reported reductions in amphetamine self-administration and anxiety, and in alcohol- and methylphenidate-induced conditioned place preference. Observational studies among healthy ritual ayahuasca users and patients with SUDs reported reductions in drug use, anxiety, and depression, and increases in quality of life and well-being. We replicated the findings of the previous review suggesting that ayahuasca and its alkaloids have therapeutic effects in the treatment of SUDs. However, translation of preclinical data to humans is limited, observational studies do not allow us to infer causality, and there is a lack of standardization on ayahuasca doses. Although promising, randomized, controlled trials are needed to better elucidate these results. The PROSPERO ID for this study is CRD42020192046.",

        "To review the main advances related to the potential therapeutic use of cannabinoid compounds in psychiatry. A search was performed in the online databases PubMed, ScieELO, and Lilacs for studies and literature reviews concerning therapeutic applications of cannabinoids in psychiatry, especially cannabidiol, rimonabant, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and their analogues. Cannabidiol was found to have therapeutic potential with antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and antidepressant properties, in addition to being effective in other conditions. Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and its analogues were shown to have anxiolytic effects in the treatment of cannabis dependence and to function as an adjuvant in the treatment of schizophrenia, although additional studies are necessary to support this finding. Rimonabant was effective in the treatment of the subjective and physiological symptoms of cannabis intoxication and functioned as an adjuvant in the treatment of tobacco addiction. The potential to induce adverse reactions such as depression and anxiety restrained the clinical use of this CB(1) antagonist. Cannabinoids may be of great therapeutic interest to psychiatry; however, further controlled trials are necessary to confirm the existing findings and to establish the safety of such compounds. ",

        "Modulators of the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) offer a promising strategy for the treatment of the cognitive deficits that are associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel class of 5-HT6R antagonists that is based on the 1H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]quinoline core. The most active compounds exhibited comparable binding affinity to the reference compound, SB-742457, and markedly improved selectivity. Lead optimization led to the identification of (S)-1-[(3-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-(pyrrolidine-3-yl-amino)-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]quinoline (14) (Ki = 3 nM and Kb = 0.41 nM). Pharmacological characterization of the 5-HT6R's constitutive activity at Gs signaling revealed that 14 behaved as a neutral antagonist, while SB-742457 was classified as an inverse agonist. Both compounds 14 and SB-742457 reversed phencyclidine-induced memory deficits and displayed distinct procognitive properties in cognitively unimpaired animals (3 mg/kg) in NOR tasks. Compounds 14 and SB-742457 were also active in the Vogel test, yet the anxiolytic effect of 14 was 2-fold higher (MED = 3 mg/kg). Moreover, 14 produced, in a 3-fold higher dose (MED = 10 mg/kg), antidepressant-like effects that were similar to those produced by SB-742457 (MED = 3 mg/kg). Together, these data suggest that the 4-(pyrrolidine-3-yl-amino)-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]quinoline scaffold is an attractive molecular framework for the development of procognitive agents. The results are promising enough to warrant further detailed mechanistic studies on the therapeutic potential of 5-HT6R antagonists and inverse agonists for the treatment of cognitive decline and depression/anxiety symptoms that are comorbidities of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Psychedelic-assisted therapies are receiving mounting attention for their therapeutic potential. However, little is known about interest among women who experience elevated risk of mental health and substance use disorders. This study examined interest in receiving psychedelic-assisted therapy and socio-structural factors associated with interest among marginalized women. Data (2016-2017) were drawn from two community-based, prospective open cohorts of >1000 marginalized women in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression examined associations with interest in receiving psychedelic-assisted therapy. Among women who used psychedelics, additional data were collected to describe ratings of personal meaningfulness, sense of wellbeing, and spiritual significance. Of 486 eligible participants (aged 20-67 years), 43% ( = 211) were interested in receiving psychedelic-assisted therapy. Over half identified as Indigenous (First Nations, Metis or Inuit). Factors independently associated with interest in psychedelic-assisted therapy in multivariable analysis included: daily crystal methamphetamine use in the last six months (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 3.02; 95%Confidence Interval (CI) 1.37-6.65), lifetime mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder) (AOR 2.13; 95%CI 1.27-3.59), childhood abuse (AOR 1.99; 95%CI 1.02-3.88), lifetime psychedelic use (AOR 1.97; 95%CI 1.14-3.38), and younger age (AOR 0.97 per year older; 95%CI 0.95-0.99). Several mental health and substance use-related variables that have been demonstrated to be amenable to psychedelic-assisted therapy were associated with interest in receiving psychedelic-assisted therapy among women in this setting. As access to psychedelic-assisted therapies continues to expand, any future approaches to extend psychedelic medicine to marginalized women should integrate trauma-informed care and broader socio-structural supports.

        "Access to the Internet has upended long-standing myths and misconceptions about autism as autistic individuals are enabled through technology increasingly to influence the dialog around neurodiversity, the experience of being autistic, and the effectiveness of mental health interventions for autistic adults. Autistic self-advocates are speaking up in support of including neurodivergent adults as a population that might benefit from the burgeoning psychedelic medicine field, in an absence of many other mental health treatment options that have been researched and shown to be effective for them. Autism is a genetically-determined neurocognitive variant with considerable heterogeneity across the broad autistic phenotype spectrum. Therefore, enthusiasm for investigating psychedelics to cure or alter the course of autism is most likely ill-informed and misdirected; psychiatric and psychopharmacological interventions do not alter the genome. However, autism frequently co-occurs with clinical conditions such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and trauma that have been investigated as indications for clinical trials with classic and atypical psychedelics. The purpose of this chapter will be to inform researchers and clinicians on the history of clinical research with classic psychedelics with autistic minors, recent and current clinical trials of atypical psychedelics with autistic adults, and considerations for providing psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies that are compatible with autism.",

        "This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-assisted therapy in patients who experienced anxiety with or without association with a life-threatening illness. The study is an investigator-initiated 2-center trial that used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, random-order, crossover design with 2 sessions with either oral LSD (200 mg) or placebo per period. The primary end point was anxiety symptoms 16 weeks after the last treatment session, assessed by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Global score in 42 patients. Further outcome measures included ratings for depression symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 21-item version) and ratings for acute subjective drug effects. The outcomes for the first period (between-subjects analysis) are primarily shown due to carryover effects. LSD treatment resulted in significant reductions of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Global scores up to 16 weeks after treatment (least-square mean [standard error] change from baseline difference = -16.2 [5.8], 95% CI, -27.8 to -4.5, d = -1.18, p = .007). Similar effects were observed for ratings of comorbid depression on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 21-item version (-7.0 [1.9], 95% CI, -10.8 to -3.2, d = -1.1, p = .0004) and the Beck Depression Inventory (-6.1 [2.6], 95% CI, -11.4 to -0.9, d = -0.72, p = .02). Positive acute subjective drug effects and mystical-type experiences correlated with the long-term reductions in anxiety symptoms. Transient, mild, acute untoward effects of LSD treatment were reported by 8 patients (19%). One treatment-related serious adverse event (acute transient anxiety) occurred (2%). LSD produced long-lasting and notable reductions in anxiety and comorbid depression symptoms up to 16 weeks. ",

        "Columbin (1) is a furanolactone diterpene isolated from the roots of Jateorhiza and Tinospora species. These species generally grow in Asia and Africa and have been used in folk medicine for their apparent analgesic and antipyretic activities. Columbin (1) is of particular interest due to its structural similarity to the known kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist salvinorin A. Given that the KOR is of interest in the study of many serious diseases, such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction, obtaining natural or semisynthetic molecules with KOR activity recently has gained much interest. For this reason, in the present study, derivatives of 1 were designed and synthesized using known structure-activity relationships of salvinorin A at KORs. The structures of the columbin analogues prepared were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy, and their KOR activity was investigated in vitro by inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Slight improvements in KOR activity were observed in columbin derivatives over their parent compound. However, despite the structural similarities to salvinorin A, neither columbin (1) nor its derivatives were potent KOR ligands. This work represents not only the first evaluation of columbin (1) at the KOR but also one of the first works to explore synthetic strategies that are tolerated on the columbin core.",

        "Whether for spiritual, recreational, or potential therapeutic use, interest in ayahuasca has grown remarkably. Ayahuasca's main active substances are N,N-dimethyltryptamine and certain monoamine oxidase inhibitor b-carbolines. Possible drug interactions are a major concern, and research is lacking in this area. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of ritual ayahuasca use regarding adverse effects and risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, ayahuasca users from a religious institution answered an online questionnaire about its safety. Adverse effects, safety measures, and possible risk factors (psychiatric diagnosis and medications) were investigated. The most frequent adverse effects among the 614 participants were transient gastrointestinal effects (nausea and vomiting). Fifty participants self-reported a psychiatric diagnosis (depression and anxiety were the most prevalent), and these participants experienced adverse effects more frequently. Psychiatric medication use was reported by 31 participants. No indication of increased adverse effects due to drug-drug interactions was found. A minority of participants reported being very negatively affected by persistent adverse effects. Psychiatric medication use while participating in ayahuasca rituals was not associated with increased adverse effects. For the most part, the institution's practices seem sufficient to prevent exacerbated reactions. Future studies may focus on negatively affected users. ",

        "Sexualized drug use (SDU) has been poorly studied among heterosexuals. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the prevalence of and gender differences in types of substances, risky sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), motivations, and psychological adjustment among heterosexual women and men who engage in SDU. The study sample consisted of 1181 heterosexuals (795 women) between 18 and 78 years old (mean age = 24.4,  = 7.4). Approximately 12% of the participants had engaged in SDU. No differences were found in the prevalence of SDU between men and women. Alcohol, cannabis, and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) were the substances most frequently used for sexual purposes. Men were significantly more likely to use MDMA, ecstasy, cocaine, and erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs, and they tended to have more sexual partners than women. Likewise, SDU was related to have more sexual partners, penetrative sex without a condom, practice a fetish, be diagnosed with syphilis, chlamydia, and others STIs, and present more depression symptoms (but not with more anxiety). In conclusion, SDU was associated with poorer physical and mental health. It is, therefore, necessary to design programs aimed at reducing the incidence of the consequences of SDU on the physical and mental health of both men and women. Moreover, programs that seek to understand why these individuals engage in SDU should be undertaken. ",

        "MDMA exerts its main effects via the serotonergic system and the serotonin transporter. The gene coding for this transporter determines the expression rate of the transporter. Previously it was shown that healthy individuals with the short allelic variant ('s-group') of the 5-HTTLPR-polymorphism displayed more anxiety and negative mood, and had a lower transcriptional efficiency compared to individuals who are homozygous for the l-allele ('l-group'). The present study aimed to investigate the role of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in MDMA-induced mood effects. Four placebo-controlled, within-subject studies were pooled, including in total 63 polydrug ecstasy users (N = 48; N = 15) receiving MDMA 75 mg and placebo on two test days, separated by minimally 7 days. Mood was assessed by means of the Profile of Mood States. Findings showed that MDMA induced -independent of sex- a positive mood state, and as a side effect also increased two negative affect states, anxiety and confusion. Anxiety ratings were higher in the l-group and independent of treatment or sex. Depression ratings were lowered by MDMA in the female l-group. Findings indicate that the MDMA-induced reduction in self-rated depressive feelings is sex- and genotype-dependent, with females homozygous for the l-allele showing this beneficial effect. ",

        "Marijuana is widely used, yet few data concerning its actions combined with other drugs exist. Psychologic, respiratory and cardiovascular effects of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active component of marijuana, combined with oxymorphone (OXM) or with pentobarbital (PBL), were studies in 15 healthy volunteers. Oxymorphone, 1.0 mg/70 kg, iv, caused sedation and ventilatory depression (minute ventilation: 24.9 plus or minus 11.9 SD to 14.1 plus or minus 4.9 1/min with PETCO2 held at 50 torr) in eight volunteers. TCH (27, 40, 60, 90, and 134 mug/kg, iv) increased sedation and further decreased ventilation with each TCH dose to 6.6 plus or minus 3.7 1/min after 134 mug/kg. The combination of OXM and THC decreased the CO2-ventilation slope from 2.23 to 0.88 1/min/torr. When THC, 134 mug/kg, was added to OXM, which alone caused no significant cardiovascular change, cardiac index (4.1 plus or minus 1.3 to 5.0 plus or minus 2.2 1/min/m-2) and heart rate (66 plus or minus 12 to 107 plus or minus 31 beats/min) significantly increased and total peripheral resistance (1,030 plus or minus 260 to 660 plus or minus 200 dynes-sec/cm-5) decreased. Heart rates exceeded 150 beats/min in two subjects after 27 and 134 mug/kg THC. Pentobarbital alone, 100 mg/70 kg, iv, caused no significant ventilatory or cardiovascular change. THC, after PBL pretreatment, induced hallucinations and anxiety in five of seven volunteers; four failed to complete all five doses of THC becuase of the severe psychologic effects. The combination of PBL and 40 to 134 mug/kg THC did not affect ventilation significantly. After PBL pretreatment, THC significantly increased heart rate (76 plus or minus 17 to 130 plus or minus 32 beats/min). Cardiac index also increased (3.8 plus or minus 0.8 to 5.6 plus or minus 1.9 1/min/m-2) and total peripheral resistance decreased (1,070 plus or minus 240 to 720 plus or minus 300 dynes-sec/cm-5). Three subjects developed heart rates esceeding 150 beats/min after 27, 27, and 90 mug/kg THC; in all three, heart rates fell from maximal value with a further dose of THC.",

        "Mescaline is a naturally occurring psychoactive alkaloid that has been used as a sacrament by Indigenous populations in spiritual ritual and healing ceremonies for millennia. Despite promising early preliminary research and favorable anecdotal reports, there is limited research investigating mescaline's psychotherapeutic potential. We administered an anonymous online questionnaire to adults ( = 452) reporting use of mescaline in naturalistic settings about mental health benefits attributed to mescaline. We assessed respondents' self-reported improvements in depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol and drug use disorders (AUD and DUD). Of the respondents reporting histories of these clinical conditions, most (68-86%) reported subjective improvement following their most memorable mescaline experience. Respondents who reported an improvement in their psychiatric conditions reported significantly higher ratings of acute psychological factors including mystical-type, psychological insight, and ego dissolution effects compared to those who did not report improvements (Cohen's  range 0.7 - 1.5). Many respondents (35-50%) rated the mescaline experience as the single or top five most spiritually significant or meaningful experience(s) of their lives. Acute experiences of psychological insight during their mescaline experience were associated with increased odds of reporting improvement in depression, anxiety, AUD and DUD. Additional research is needed to corroborate these preliminary findings and to rigorously examine the efficacy of mescaline for psychiatric treatment in controlled, longitudinal clinical trials. ",

        "In a recent issue of the BMC Psychiatry, the evidence of effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions in end-stage cancer patients was reviewed (Johnson, 2018). The review was comprehensive, and included traditional and non-traditional/alternative treatments, including herbal medicines and spirituality. However, evidence showing that classic or serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) could be effective treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer was not included. In this commentary, we expand the information available on the original article by briefly reviewing data from recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials showing evidence that administration of single (or few) doses of LSD and psilocybin was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with end-stage cancer and other life-threatening diseases (e.g., Bechterew's disease, Parkinson's disease, Celiac disease). Since these substances seem to produce rapid and sustained therapeutic effects with single (or few) doses and well tolerated, large-scale, prospective, multi-site studies of end-stage cancer and classical/serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics should be performed to improve our understanding of the therapeutic potentials of these drugs and their use on clinical practice.",

        "Despite high rates of use of both cannabis and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), little is known about the role of cannabis use among ENDS users and of ENDS use among cannabis users. This study tested whether dual use was related to more frequent use, use-related problems, and negative affect. Among cannabis users (n=315), ENDS was associated with more frequent cannabis use, cannabis-related problems, anxiety, and depression. Among ENDS users (n=156), cannabis was associated with more frequent ENDS use, ENDS-related problems, and anxiety. Overall, ENDS use is common among cannabis users and cannabis use is common among ENDS users. Further, use of both of these substances is related to more use, use-related problems, and negative affect, especially anxiety.",

After reviewing this literature, the present communication summarizes new experiments designed to clarify and extend the nature of the pharmacological and biochemical differences between the lines. A challenge with the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist, DOI, produced similar degrees of head shakes and skin crawls in the HDS and LDS rats, suggesting similar sensitivity of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors. In contrast, DOI-induced flat body posture (FBP), which has been linked to 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation, was observed more readily in the HDS rats. The HDS and LDS rats exhibited similar degrees of increase in 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in several brain regions. This result suggests that the dramatic differences in hypothermia in HDS and LDS rats cannot be related to 5-HT(1A) receptor-mediated action on G proteins. Overall, these findings indicate that the selective breeding for 5-HT(1A)-mediated hypothermia has been fairly selective, and that differences in emotionally relevant behaviors between these two rat lines can strongly be associated with an unidentified component of the 5-HT(1A) receptor signaling pathway.",

Endocannabinoids are an important class of lipid messenger molecules that are produced on demand in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels. They recognize and activate the cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, the molecular targets for Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) in marijuana evoking several beneficial therapeutic effects. However, in vivo the cannabimimetic effects of AEA and 2-AG remain weak owing to their rapid inactivation by FAAH and MGL, respectively. The inactivation of FAAH and MGL by specific enzyme inhibitors increases the levels of AEA and 2-AG, respectively, producing therapeutic effects such as pain relief and depression of anxiety.",

        "Numerous clinical studies have shown that the serotonergic system also degenerates in patients with Parkinson's disease. The causal role of this impairment in Parkinson's symptomatology and the response to treatment remains to be refined, in particular thanks to approaches allowing the two components DA and 5-HT to be isolated if possible. We have developed a macaque monkey model of Parkinson's disease exhibiting a double lesion (dopaminergic and serotonergic) thanks to the sequential use of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine) (or MDMA prior MPTP). We characterized this monkey model by multimodal imaging (PET, positron emission tomography with several radiotracers; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging), behavioral assessments (parkinsonism, dyskinesia, neuropsychiatric-like behavior) and post-mortem analysis (with DA and 5-HT markers). When administrated after MPTP, MDMA damaged the 5-HT presynaptic system without affecting the remaining DA neurons. The lesion of 5-HT fibers induced by MDMA altered rigidity and prevented dyskinesia and neuropsychiatric-like symptoms induced by levodopa therapy in MPTP-treated animals. Interestingly also, prior MDMA administration aggravates the parkinsonian deficits and associated DA injury. Dystonic postures, action tremor and global spontaneous activities were significantly affected. All together, these data clearly indicate that late or early lesions of the 5-HT system have a differential impact on parkinsonian symptoms in the macaque model of Parkinson's disease. Whether MDMA has an impact on neuropsychiatric-like symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression remains to be addressed. Despite its limitations, this toxin-based double-lesioned monkey model takes on its full meaning and provides material for the experimental study of the heterogeneity of patients.",

        "The therapeutic potential of medical cannabis to treat a variety of conditions is becoming increasingly recognised. Globally, a large number of countries have now legalised cannabis for medical uses and a substantial number of patients are able to access their medications. Yet in the UK, where medical cannabis was legalised in November 2018, only a handful of NHS prescriptions have been written, meaning that most patients are unable to access the medicine. Reasons for this are manyfold and include the perceived lack of clinical evidence due to the challenges of studying medical cannabis through randomised controlled trials. In order to develop the current evidence base, the importance of incorporating real-world data (RWD) to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of medical cannabis has gradually become recognised. The current paper provides a detailed outline of Project Twenty21 (T21), the UK's first medical cannabis registry, launched in August 2020. We provide the rationale for T21 and describe the methodology before reporting the characteristics of the 'first patients' enrolled in the registry. We describe the health status of all patients enrolled into the project during its first 7 months of operation and the sociodemographic characteristics and primary presenting conditions for these patients, as well as details of the medical cannabis prescribed to these individuals. By 12th March 2021, 678 people had been enrolled into T21; the majority (64%) were male and their average age was 38.7 years (range = 18-80). The most commonly reported primary conditions were chronic pain (55.6%) and anxiety disorders (32.0%) and they reported high levels of multi-morbidity, including high rates of insomnia and depression. We also present preliminary evidence from 75 patients followed up after 3 months indicating that receipt of legal, prescribed cannabis was associated with a significant increase in self-reported health, assessed using the visual analogue scale of the EQ-5D-5L (Cohen's d = .77, 95% CI = .51-1.03). Our initial findings complement reports from other large-scale databases globally, indicating that the current RWD is building up a pattern of evidence. With many clinicians demanding better and faster evidence to inform their decisions around prescribing medical cannabis, the current and future results of T21 will expand the existing evidence base on the effectiveness of cannabis-based medical products (CBMPs).",

        "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is one of the most potent psychoactive agents known, producing dramatic alterations of consciousness after submilligram (>=20 mg) oral doses. Following the accidental discovery of its potent psychoactive effects in 1943, it was supplied by Sandoz Laboratories as an experimental drug that might be useful as an adjunct for psychotherapy, or to give psychiatrists insight into the mental processes in their patients. The finding of serotonin in the mammalian brain in 1953, and its structural resemblance to LSD, quickly led to ideas that serotonin in the brain might be involved in mental disorders, initiating rapid research interest in the neurochemistry of serotonin. LSD proved to be physiologically very safe and nonaddictive, with a very low incidence of adverse events when used in controlled experiments. Widely hailed by psychiatry as a breakthrough in the 1950s and early 1960s, clinical research with LSD ended by about 1970, when it was formally placed into Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 following its growing popularity as a recreational drug. Within the past 5 years, clinical research with LSD has begun in Europe, but there has been none in the United States. LSD is proving to be a powerful tool to help understand brain dynamics when combined with modern brain imaging methods. It remains to be seen whether therapeutic value for LSD can be confirmed in controlled clinical trials, but promising results have been obtained in small pilot trials of depression, anxiety, and addictions using psilocybin, a related psychedelic molecule.",

        "Neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress represent a substantial long-term challenge for the global health systems because of their rising prevalence, uncertain neuropathology, and lack of effective pharmacological treatments. The approved existing studies constitute a piece of strong evidence whereby psychiatric drugs have shown to have unpleasant side effects and reduction of sustained tolerability, impacting patients' quality of life. Thus, the implementation of innovative strategies and alternative sources of bioactive molecules for the search for neuropsychiatric agents are required to guarantee the success of more effective drug candidates. Psychotherapeutic use of indole alkaloids derived from magic mushrooms has shown great interest and potential as an alternative to the synthetic drugs currently used on the market. The focus on indole alkaloids is linked to their rich history, their use as pharmaceuticals, and their broad range of biological properties, collectively underscoring the indole heterocycle as significant in drug discovery. In this review, we aim to report the physicochemical and pharmacological characteristics of indole alkaloids, particularly those derived from magic mushrooms, highlighting the promising application of such active ingredients as safe and effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "While tobacco product (such as combustible cigarettes and nicotine vaping products) and cannabis use rates remain high in the general United States (U.S.) population, veterans from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (i.e., OEF/OIF veterans) are at high risk of high rates of cannabis and tobacco use. Co-use of tobacco and cannabis (i.e., using both substances within a specified period of time or combining the drugs within the same device for use) is of growing prevalence in the U.S. However, little is understood about the prevalence rates of tobacco and cannabis co-use among U.S. veterans and its associations with mental health symptomatology. The current study conducted a preliminary analysis of co-use patterns of tobacco and cannabis and associated mental health outcomes among a sample of OEF/OIF veterans (N = 1,230). Results indicated high rates of lifetime and past 30-day use of both substances. Past 30-day co-users endorsed significantly higher levels of stress, PTSD, depression, and anxiety compared to singular product users. Results suggest that the addition of cannabis use in conjunction with tobacco use may be associated with greater mental health symptoms among veterans. Findings indicate veteran tobacco and cannabis co-users may benefit from mental health care to help mitigate poor mental health symptoms.",

        "Hallucinogens like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and substituted N-benzyl phenylalkylamines are widely used recreationally with psilocybin being considered as a therapeutic for many neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. How psychedelics mediate their actions-both therapeutic and hallucinogenic-are not understood, although activation of the 5-HT serotonin receptor (HTR2A) is key. To gain molecular insights into psychedelic actions, we determined the active-state structure of HTR2A bound to 25-CN-NBOH-a prototypical hallucinogen-in complex with an engineered Gaq heterotrimer by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We also obtained the X-ray crystal structures of HTR2A complexed with the arrestin-biased ligand LSD or the inverse agonist methiothepin. Comparisons of these structures reveal determinants responsible for HTR2A-Gaq protein interactions as well as the conformational rearrangements involved in active-state transitions. Given the potential therapeutic actions of hallucinogens, these findings could accelerate the discovery of more selective drugs for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. ",

        "The differential diagnosis of psychotic symptoms is broad and extends beyond primary psychotic and affective disorders. We aim to illustrate that the chronology and phenomenological nature of hallucinatory symptoms may provide clues towards alternative diagnoses, such as hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD). We describe the resurgence of visual pseudo-hallucinations in a young woman in the context of previous substance-induced hallucinatory symptoms and a prior diagnosis of occipital lobe epilepsy. She presented a diagnostic challenge, saw several emergency and specialist doctors and attracted stigmatising diagnoses leading to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Her symptoms were finally recognised as HPPD, and she was treated appropriately with lamotrigine. Patients with perceptual disturbance can present in various clinical settings, and HPPD is an under-recognised diagnostic possibility. Delayed or misdiagnosis prolongs profound functional impairment and social decline, and predisposes the patient to the development of anxiety and depression and related increased risk of suicide. ",

        "Abuse of more than one psychoactive drug is becoming a global problem. Our experiments were designed to examine the effects of a concomitant administration of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and mephedrone on depression- and anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive processes in Swiss mice. In order to investigate the drug interactions the forced swimming test (FST) - an animal model of depression, the passive avoidance (PA) test - a memory and learning paradigm, as well as the elevated plus maze (EPM) test - test for anxiety level were used. The results revealed that a concomitant administration of non-effective doses of mephedrone (1mg/kg) and MDMA (1mg/kg) exerted marked antidepressive effects in the FST. Also a co-administration of mephedrone (2.5mg/kg) and MDMA (1mg/kg) displayed a pro-cognitive action in the PA paradigm. Furthermore, even though mephedrone and MDMA can, in general, exert some anxiogenic effects in mice, the concomitant administration of nonactive doses of both drugs (0.05 and 0.1mg/kg, respectively) in the EPM test, did not show any synergistic effect in our study. The effects of mephedrone and MDMA combination on mammalian organisms were attempted to be evaluated in our study and the results are described in the present report. These results may help explain the reasons for and consequences of a concomitant administration of psychoactive substances with regards to the central nervous system, while being possibly useful in the treatment of polydrug intoxication.

        "This case study concerns a 26-yr.-old male who had consumed large amounts of Ecstasy seven years previously. He stated that his increasingly intensive use of ecstasy over a 4-yr. period had led to the emergence of multiple psychiatric and psychological problems. Given these problems, he stopped using Ecstasy, but the problems had not resolved despite seven years of abstinence. The neurocognitive profile was very similar to that shown by current heavy Ecstasy users, with deficits in immediate and delayed verbal recall, moderately impaired memory function, but normal expressive language ability and perceptual functioning. Extremely high pathology was evident, including depression and phobic anxiety. Severe problems with sleep and sex were also reported. Further studies involving larger groups of abstinent former users are needed; adverse sequelae associated with intensive Ecstasy use may sometimes be enduring.",

        "The present study was aimed at identifying patterns of Ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine-MDMA) use in the city of Sao Paulo. Ecstasy users were recruited through the snowball technique. Using the same technique, a non-user control group was recruited among individuals that had never tried the drug but shared with users a similar life style. Users (N = 52) and non-users (N = 52) were interviewed in order to obtain data on socio-demographic characteristics and use of psychoactive drugs. In addition, levels of anxiety, depression and impulsiveness were assessed through Spielberger's IDATE Trace Inventory, Beck's Depression Inventory and Barrat Impulsiveness Scale. Both users and non-users revealed similar socio-demographic characteristics: most subjects were middle class young heterosexual single men and women who had a college degree. Multiple drug use was more frequent among users than among non-users. Other features that were significantly more accentuated among users than among non-users were the presence of tattoos and piercings, the frequency of attending raves and the preference for electronic music. Beck Inventory results pointed to significantly lower depression scores among users. No differences were observed between groups regarding anxiety and impulsiveness scores. Although the use of Ecstasy in Sao Paulo is restricted to a young middle or high social class, their vanguard lifestyle tends to influence youngsters of other social extractions, so that the use of the drug may soon become widespread and thus a legitimate public health concern.",

        "This study examined drug use patterns and psychiatric symptoms of anxiety and depression among young Brazilian sexual minority ecstasy and LSD users and compared findings with those reported for their heterosexual peers. This cross-sectional study employed targeted sampling and ethnographic mapping approaches via face-to-face interviews conducted at bars and electronic music festivals using an adapted, semi-structured version of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs questionnaire. The sample comprised 240 male and female young adults who had used ecstasy and/or LSD in the 90 days prior to the interview and who were not on treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. Of the 240 subjects enrolled (mean age: 22.9+-4.5 years), 28.7% were gay or bisexuals. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the prevalence of depression symptoms in the past 12 months in the sexual minority group was 37% higher than among heterosexuals (prevalence ratio [PR]=1.79; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.03-3.11; p=0.037). Strategies should be developed to assess and address individual needs and treatment approaches should be tailored to address depressive symptoms in young, sexual minority club drug users. ",

        "The use of illegal drugs is common in alcohol dependence and significant psychological and social consequences are associated with the concurrent use of alcohol and illegal drugs. However, little literature has examined the patterns of concurrent-drug use in alcohol dependent individuals. A latent class analysis (LCA) was used to determine whether patterns of past year illegal drug use existed in a national sample of 6059 alcohol dependent respondents of the combined 2005, 2006 and 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to determine whether demographic variables, mental health disturbance and social consequences were predictive of drug use classes. Results of the LCA demonstrated a 5-class solution with optimal fit deduced by Bayesian Information Criterion minima. The five classes included: a close to zero probability of illegal drug use (class 1: 65%), medium marijuana, medium sedatives/tranquilizers and high analgesics (class 2: 7%), high marijuana, medium cocaine use (class 3: 21%), high probabilities of marijuana, cocaine, sedatives and analgesic use (class 4: 6%) and a high concurrent-drug use except other hallucinogens (class 5: 1%). Regression results suggest that younger age, comorbidity, engaging in deviant behaviors, sexually transmitted infection and incarceration are associated with concurrent illegal drug use in alcohol dependent individuals. Findings advocate that more intense psychiatric and drug dependence treatment resources may be needed for concurrent-drug using alcohol dependent populations and provide evidence for targeted prevention and treatment interventions.",

        "Postpartum depression (PPD) has a prevalence rate of 13% and a similarly high proportion of women report a subclinical state of one or more major depressive episode symptoms. The aim was to investigate whether monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) VT, an index of MAO-A density, is increased in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (PFC and ACC), during PPD or when a PPD spectrum symptom, greater predisposition to crying, is present. MAO-A is an enzyme that increases in density after estrogen decline, and has several functions including creating oxidative stress, influencing apoptosis and monoamine metabolism. Fifty-seven women were recruited including 15 first-onset, antidepressant naive, PPD subjects, 12 postpartum healthy who cry due to sad mood, 15 asymptomatic postpartum healthy women, and 15 healthy women not recently pregnant. Each underwent [(11)C]-harmine positron emission tomography scanning to measure MAO-A VT. Both PPD and greater predisposition to crying were associated with greater MAO-A VT in the PFC and ACC (multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), group effect, F21,135=1.856; p=0.019; mean combined region elevation 21% and 14% in PPD and crying groups, respectively, relative to postpartum asymptomatic). Greater MAO-A VT in the PFC and ACC represents a new biomarker in PPD, and the PPD symptom of predisposition to crying. Novel strategies for preventing PPD (and some PPD symptoms) may be possible by avoiding environmental conditions that elevate MAO-A level and enhancing conditions that normalize MAO-A level. These findings also argue for clinical trials in PPD with the newer, well-tolerated MAO-A inhibitor antidepressants.",

        "U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans are at increased risk for a variety of mental health problems and cognitive impairment associated with military service. Current treatments are lacking in effectiveness and adherence. Therefore, this study examined psychedelic treatment with ibogaine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine for trauma-related psychological and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans. We conducted a survey of Veterans who completed a specific psychedelic clinical program in Mexico between 2017 and 2019. Questions probed retrospective reports of mental health and cognitive functioning during the 30 days before and 30 days after treatment. A total of 65 people completed treatment during this time frame and were eligible for contact. Of these, 51 (78%) completed the survey and were included in data analyses (mean age = 40; male = 96%; married = 55%; Caucasian/White = 92%; Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Service = 96%). Results indicated significant and very large reductions in retrospective report of suicidal ideation (p < .001; d = -1.9), cognitive impairment (p < .001; d = -2.8), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (p < .001; d = -3.6), depression (p < .001; d = -3.7), and anxiety (p < .001; d = -3.1). Results also showed a significant and large increase in retrospective report of psychological flexibility (p < .001; d = 2.9) from before-to-after the psychedelic treatment. Increases in the retrospective report of psychological flexibility were strongly associated with retrospective report of reductions in cognitive impairment, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (rs range -0.61 to -0.75; p < .001). Additionally, most participants rated the psychedelic experiences as one of the top five personally meaningful (84%), spiritually significant (88%), and psychologically insightful (86%) experiences of their lives.: Several limitations should be considered including the retrospective, self-report, survey design of the study, and the lack of randomization and blinding, thus making these finding preliminary. U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans may have unique treatment needs because of the sequela of problems associated with repeated trauma exposure and the nature of the exposure. Psychedelic-assisted therapy with these under-researched psychedelics may hold unique promise for this population. However, controlled studies are needed to determine whether this treatment is efficacious in relieving mental health and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans. ",

A clinical research unit within a large public sector academic medical center. Twelve adults with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. In addition to monitoring safety and subjective experience before and during experimental treatment sessions, follow-up data including results from the Beck Depression Inventory, Profile of Mood States, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were collected unblinded for 6 months after treatment. Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. This study established the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long-neglected field. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00302744.

        "Given ecstasy's (MDMA) potential serotonergic neurotoxicity, it is plausible that regular ecstasy users would have an elevated prevalence of behavioral executive dysfunction or mood symptoms. However, recent studies have found that the relationship between ecstasy use and psychological symptoms was no longer significant after controlling for marijuana use (e.g., Morgan et al., 2002). The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between ecstasy exposure and self-reported executive functioning and psychological symptoms after controlling for gender, ethnicity, and other drug use. Data were collected from 65 men and women with a wide range of ecstasy use (including 17 marijuana-using controls). Participants were administered the Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults, and the Beck Depression Inventory-2nd edition. Although 19-63% of the ecstasy users demonstrated clinically elevated psychological symptoms, frequency of ecstasy use did not predict the psychological symptoms. No gender differences or interactions were observed. These results revealed that, although ecstasy users demonstrate elevated levels of psychological symptoms and executive dysfunction, these symptoms are not statistically associated with their ecstasy consumption. Instead, other drug use (alcohol, marijuana, opioids, and inhalants) significantly predict psychological symptoms in this sample of polydrug users. ",

        "Cannabis use is common among adolescents and some research suggests that adolescent cannabis use increases the risk for depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairments in adulthood. In human studies, however, confounds may affect the association between cannabis use and the development of brain disorders. These experiments investigated the effects of adolescent exposure to either cannabis smoke or THC on anxiety- and depressive-like behavior and cognitive performance in adulthood in Long-Evans rats. Adolescent rats of both sexes were exposed to either cannabis smoke from postnatal days (P) 29-49 or ascending doses of THC from P35-45. When the rats reached adulthood (P70), anxiety-like behavior was investigated in the large open field and elevated plus maze, depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference and forced swim tests, and cognitive function in the novel object recognition test. Despite sex differences on some measures in the open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim, and novel object recognition tests, there were no effects of either adolescent cannabis smoke or THC exposure, and only relatively subtle interactions between exposure conditions and sex, such that sex differences on some performance measures were slightly attenuated. Neither cannabis smoke nor THC exposure during adolescence produced robust alterations in adult behavior after a period of abstinence, suggesting that adverse effects associated with adolescent cannabis use might be due to non-cannabinoid concomitants of cannabis use.

        "Antidepressant, atypical antipsychotic, and hallucinogen drugs mediate their actions in part by interactions with the serotonin-2A (5HT2A) receptor. Serotonergic hallucinogen drugs, such as psilocybin, bind most potently as agonists at the 5HT2A receptor, producing profound changes in perception, mood, and cognition. Some of these drugs have been or are currently being investigated in small Phase 2 studies for depression, alcoholism, smoking cessation, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, unlike the synergistic effects of combining antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic drugs, the potential therapeutic effects of hallucinogen drugs may be attenuated by the concurrent use of these medications because antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic drugs desensitize and/or down-regulate 5HT2A receptors. This finding has important implications for optimizing the potential therapeutic use of hallucinogen drugs in psychiatry.

        "Terminally ill patients may experience existential distress, depression, or anxiety, limiting quality of life in the final stage. Existing psychotherapeutic or pharmacological interventions have (time) limited efficacy. Psychedelic treatment may be a safe and effective alternative treatment option. Systematically review studies on psychedelic treatment with and without psychotherapy for existential distress, depression, and anxiety in terminally ill patients. Medline, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for original-data studies on the treatment of depression, anxiety, and existential distress with classical or a-typical psychedelics in patients with a terminal illness, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A total of 1850 records were screened, and 33 articles were included in this review: 14 studies on classical psychedelics (DPT, LSD, and psilocybin) and 19 studies on atypical psychedelics (MDMA and ketamine). Results of early pre-post studies are promising but have serious methodological flaws. Recent (controlled) trials with LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA are of higher methodological quality and indicate positive effects on existential and spiritual well-being, quality of life, acceptance, and reduction of anxiety and depression with few adverse and no serious adverse effects. Both classical and a-typical psychedelics are promising treatment options in patients with terminal illness. To draw final conclusions on effectiveness and safety of psychedelics, we need larger high-quality studies for classical psychedelics and MDMA. Ketamine studies should pay more attention to existential dimensions of well-being and the psychotherapeutic context of the treatment. ",

        "The regular use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) has been associated with depressed mood, anxiety and hostility, but it is not known whether such effects persist after people stop using the drug. Furthermore, little is known about what factors might influence the decision to quit using MDMA. The aim of the present study was to examine the reasons why ex-users had stopped using this drug and to assess their current levels of depression, anxiety, anger and aggression. Telephone interviews were conducted with people who used to take MDMA on a regular basis but who no longer used the drug. The participants comprised sixty-six ex-users who used to take MDMA regularly (at least once every 2 months over a period of at least 1 year), but who had not taken MDMA for at least 1 year (average 3 years). Participants were asked about why they had quit MDMA. They also completed questionnaires to assess trait mood. Ex-users could be divided into two groups based on their reason for quitting: (i) those who had quit for mental health reasons and (ii) those who had quit for circumstantial reasons. Approximately half of those in the mental health group scored in the range for clinical depression. In that group, current levels of depression and anxiety correlated significantly with the cumulative amount of MDMA that they had taken several years previously. These findings suggest that some users may either be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of MDMA or have pre-existing mental health problems for which they self-medicate by using ecstasy. The present study shows that some ex-users experience an impairment to mental health that persists for years after they stop using this drug.",

        "Microdosing psychedelics is the practice of consuming very low, sub-hallucinogenic doses of a psychedelic substance, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or psilocybin-containing mushrooms. According to media reports, microdosing has grown in popularity, yet the scientific literature contains minimal research on this practice. There has been limited reporting on adverse events associated with microdosing, and the experiences of microdosers in community samples have not been categorized. In the present study, we develop a codebook of microdosing benefits and challenges (MDBC) based on the qualitative reports of a real-world sample of 278 microdosers. We describe novel findings, both in terms of beneficial outcomes, such as improved mood (26.6%) and focus (14.8%), and in terms of challenging outcomes, such as physiological discomfort (18.0%) and increased anxiety (6.7%). We also show parallels between benefits and drawbacks and discuss the implications of these results. We probe for substance-dependent differences, finding that psilocybin-only users report the benefits of microdosing were more important than other users report. These mixed-methods results help summarize and frame the experiences reported by an active microdosing community as high-potential avenues for future scientific research. The MDBC taxonomy reported here informs future research, leveraging participant reports to distil the highest-potential intervention targets so research funding can be efficiently allocated. Microdosing research complements the full-dose literature as clinical treatments are developed and neuropharmacological mechanisms are sought. This framework aims to inform researchers and clinicians as experimental microdosing research begins in earnest in the years to come. ",

        "In recent years the use of illicit drugs has increased among adolescents in Sweden. Prolonged use of illicit drugs causes different psychiatric symptoms, but usage of short duration has also been reported to induce similar symptoms. It is less known how these psychiatric symptoms caused by occasional intake of illicit drugs are managed. The present study examined to which extent students in senior high school (third grade) have experienced psychiatric symptoms due to intake of illicit drugs, and to which extent they sought support in their nearby environment or professional help for these problems. The result shows that out of 104 18-year old students, 25 percent had tested illicit drugs, with no significant gender difference. 38 percent of the users reported psychiatric symptoms. In most of these cases either amphetamine or ecstasy had been used. The most common negative feelings reported were worry/anxiety, low spiritedness/depression, and feelings of unreality. The majority had not sought help for their problems among friends or adults. No one sought professional help. The frequency of adolescents that have tried drugs is on a level with other national surveys. Therefore it is most likely that the results regarding students who had experienced drug related psychiatric symptoms, and how they handled this experience, are representative for other eighteen-year-olds as well. It is of great concern that schools, medical services and social services have the knowledge that one fourth of the adolescents are trying illicit drugs, and almost four out of ten experience drug related psychiatric symptoms but most of them do not seek support or treatment for these symptoms.",

        "The opioid epidemic is a significant public health concern, particularly among adults with chronic pain. There are high rates of cannabis co-use among these individuals and co-use is related to worse opioid-related outcomes. Yet, little work has examined mechanisms underlying this relationship. In line with affective processing models of substance use, it is possible that those who use multiple substances do so in a maladaptive attempt to cope with psychological distress. We tested whether, among adults with chronic lower back pain (CLBP), the relation between co-use and more severe opioid-related problems would occur via the serial effects of negative affect (anxiety, depression) and more coping motivated opioid use. After controlling for pain severity and relevant demographics, co-use remained related to more anxiety, depression, and opioid-related problems (but not more opioid use). Further, co-use was indirectly related to more opioid-related problems via the serial effect of negative affect (anxiety, depression) and coping motives. Alternative model testing found co-use was not indirectly related to anxiety or depression via serial effects of opioid problems and coping. Results highlight the important role negative affect may play in opioid problems among individuals with CLBP who co-use opioid and cannabis. ",

        "Psychedelic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin, exert profound effects on brain and behavior. After decades of difficulties in studying these compounds, psychedelics are again being tested as potential treatments for intractable biomedical disorders. Preclinical research of psychedelics complements human neuroimaging studies and pilot clinical trials, suggesting these compounds as promising treatments for addiction, depression, anxiety, and other conditions. However, many questions regarding the mechanisms of action, safety, and efficacy of psychedelics remain. Here, we summarize recent preclinical and clinical data in this field, discuss their pharmacological mechanisms of action, and outline critical areas for future studies of psychedelic drugs, with the goal of maximizing the potential benefits of translational psychedelic biomedicine to patients.",

        "Cocaine abuse remains a public health concern for which pharmacotherapies are largely ineffective. Comorbidities between cocaine abuse, depression, and anxiety support the development of novel treatments targeting multiple symptom clusters. Selective negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) targeting the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) subtype are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and have shown promise in preclinical models of substance abuse. However, complete blockade or inverse agonist activity by some full mGlu5 NAM chemotypes demonstrated adverse effects, including psychosis in humans and psychotomimetic-like effects in animals, suggesting a narrow therapeutic window. Development of partial mGlu5 NAMs, characterized by their submaximal but saturable levels of blockade, may represent a novel approach to broaden the therapeutic window. To understand potential therapeutic vs adverse effects in preclinical behavioral assays, we examined the partial mGlu5 NAMs, M-5MPEP and Br-5MPEPy, in comparison with the full mGlu5 NAM MTEP across models of addiction and psychotomimetic-like activity. M-5MPEP, Br-5MPEPy, and MTEP dose-dependently decreased cocaine self-administration and attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. M-5MPEP and Br-5MPEPy also demonstrated antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activity. Dose-dependent effects of partial and full mGlu5 NAMs in these assays corresponded with increasing in vivo mGlu5 occupancy, demonstrating an orderly occupancy-to-efficacy relationship. PCP-induced hyperlocomotion was potentiated by MTEP, but not by M-5MPEP and Br-5MPEPy. Further, MTEP, but not M-5MPEP, potentiated the discriminative-stimulus effects of PCP. The present data suggest that partial mGlu5 NAM activity is sufficient to produce therapeutic effects similar to full mGlu5 NAMs, but with a broader therapeutic index.",

        "Basic pain research has shed light on key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nociceptive and phenomenological aspects of pain. Despite these advances, we still yearn for the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to address the unmet needs of about 70 % of chronic neuropathic pain patients whose pain fails to respond to opioids as well as to other conventional analgesic agents. Importantly, a substantial body of clinical observations over the past decade cumulatively suggests that the psychedelic class of drugs may possess heuristic value for understanding and treating chronic pain conditions. The present review presents a theoretical framework for hitherto insufficiently understood neuroscience-based mechanisms of psychedelics' potential analgesic effects. To that end, searches of PubMed-indexed journals were performed using the following Medical Subject Headings' terms: pain, analgesia, inflammatory, brain connectivity, ketamine, psilocybin, functional imaging, and dendrites. Recursive sets of scientific and clinical evidence extracted from this literature review were summarized within the following key areas: (1) studies employing psychedelics for alleviation of physical and emotional pain; (2) potential neuro-restorative effects of psychedelics to remediate the impaired connectivity underlying the dissociation between pain-related conscious states/cognitions and the subcortical activity/function leading to the eventual chronicity through immediate and long-term effects on dentritic plasticity; (3) anti-neuroinflammatory and pro-immunomodulatory actions of psychedelics as the may pertain to the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain; (4) safety, legal, and ethical consideration inherent in psychedelics' pharmacotherapy. In addition to direct beneficial effects in terms of reduction of pain and suffering, psychedelics' inclusion in the analgesic armamentarium will contribute to deeper and more sophisticated insights not only into pain syndromes but also into frequently comorbid psychiatric condition associated with emotional pain, e.g., depressive and anxiety disorders. Further inquiry is clearly warranted into the above areas that have potential to evolve into further elucidate the mechanisms of chronic pain and affective disorders, and lead to the development of innovative, safe, and more efficacious neurobiologically-based therapeutic approaches.",

        "Obesity is one of the highest preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the developed world [1]. It has been well known for a long time that exposure to cannabis produces an increase of appetite (a phenomenon referred to as the 'munchies'). This phenomenon led to an exploration of the role of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of obesity and associated metabolic syndrome. This effort subsequently led to the development of a successful therapeutic approach for obesity that consisted of blocking the cannabinoid CB1 receptors using ligands such as Rimonabant in order to produce weight loss and improve metabolic profile [2]. Despite being efficacious, Rimonabant was associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety and therefore removed from the market. We recently discovered that the prevalence of obesity is paradoxically much lower in cannabis users as compared to non-users and that this difference is not accounted for by tobacco smoking status and is still present after adjusting for variables such as sex and age. Here, we propose that this effect is directly related to exposure to the D(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) present in cannabis smoke. We therefore propose the seemingly paradoxical hypothesis that THC or a THC/cannabidiol combination drug may produce weight loss and may be a useful therapeutic for the treatment of obesity and its complications.",

        "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating, chronic disorder and efficacy rates of current PTSD treatments are underwhelming. There is a critical need for innovative approaches. We provide an overview of trauma and PTSD and cite literature providing converging evidence of the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for PTSD. No study to date has investigated psilocybin or psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) as treatments for PTSD. An open-label study in traumatized AIDS survivors found that PAP reduced PTSD symptoms, attachment anxiety, and demoralization. Several PAP trials show preliminary efficacy in facilitating confronting traumatic memories, decreasing emotional avoidance, depression, anxiety, pessimism, and disconnection from others, and increasing acceptance, self-compassion, and forgiveness of abusers, all of which are relevant to PTSD recovery. There is also early evidence that other classic psychedelics may produce large reductions in PTSD symptoms in combat veterans. However, this body of literature is small, mechanisms are not yet well understood, and the risks of using psychedelic compounds for trauma-related disorders need further study. In sum, evidence supports further investigation of PAP as a radically new approach for treating PTSD.",

        "Previous research has indicated that non-dependent polydrug users are willing to pay more money to buy good quality drugs as their income increased. This study sought to examine whether altering the perceived quality of controlled drugs would affect drug purchases if the monetary price remained fixed. A random sample of 80 polydrug users were recruited. All participants were administered an anonymous questionnaire consisting of the Drug Abuse Screening Test for Adolescents (DAST-A), the Severity of Dependence Scale for cannabis (SDS), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and questions about their drug use. Participants then completed a simulation of controlled drug purchases where the price of alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy remained the same but their perceived quality changed (i.e. unit price increased as the perceived quality decreased). The demand for alcohol was quality inelastic and alcohol quality had no effects on the purchase of any other controlled drug. Demand for cannabis was quality elastic and alcohol substituted for cannabis as its unit price increased. Demand for cocaine was quality elastic and alcohol, cannabis, and ecstasy substituted for cocaine as its unit price increased. Demand for ecstasy was quality elastic and alcohol and cocaine both substituted for ecstasy as its unit price increased. These results suggest that perceived quality influences the demand for controlled drugs and that monitoring the perceived quality of controlled drugs may provide a warning of potential public health problems in the near future.",

        "In this Part II psychiatric disorders coexisting with organic diseases are discussed. \"Comorbidity phenomenon\" defines the not univocal interrelation between medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders, each other negatively influencing morbidity and mortality. Most severe psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, show increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, related to poverty, use of psychotropic medication, and higher rate of preventable risk factors such as smoking, addiction, poor diet and lack of exercise. Moreover, psychiatric and organic disorders can develop together in different conditions of toxic substance and prescription drug use or abuse, especially in the emergency setting population. Different combinations with mutual interaction of psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders are defined by the so called \"dual diagnosis\". The hypotheses that attempt to explain the psychiatric disorders and substance abuse relationship are examined: (1) common risk factors; (2) psychiatric disorders precipitated by substance use; (3) psychiatric disorders precipitating substance use (self-medication hypothesis); and (4) synergistic interaction. Diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty concerning the problem of dual diagnosis, and legal implications, are also discussed. Substance induced psychiatric and organic symptoms can occur both in the intoxication and withdrawal state. Since ancient history, humans selected indigene psychotropic plants for recreational, medicinal, doping or spiritual purpose. After the isolation of active principles or their chemical synthesis, higher blood concentrations reached predispose to substance use, abuse and dependence. Abuse substances have specific molecular targets and very different acute mechanisms of action, mainly involving dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems, but finally converging on the brain's reward pathways, increasing dopamine in nucleus accumbens. The most common substances producing an addiction status may be assembled in depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates), stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine, caffeine, modafinil), hallucinogens (mescaline, LSD, ecstasy) and other substances (cannabis, dissociatives, inhalants). Anxiety disorders can occur in intoxication by stimulants, as well as in withdrawal syndrome, both by stimulants and sedatives. Substance induced mood disorders and psychotic symptoms are as much frequent conditions in ED, and the recognition of associated organic symptoms may allow to achieve diagnosis. Finally, psychiatric and organic symptoms may be caused by prescription and doping medications, either as a direct effect or after withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions can be divided in type A, dose dependent and predictable, including psychotropic drugs and hormones; and type B, dose independent and unpredictable, usually including non psychotropic drugs, more commonly included being cardiovascular, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic medications.",

        "The study aims to describe ayahuasca users in Estonia and compare their mental health and quality of life to those of nonusers. Ceremonial practices, motivation for ayahuasca use, use-related experiences, and subjective consequences of use are described. We conducted a cross-sectional case-controlled study of thirty ayahuasca users and thirty nonusers matched by gender, age, and education. The participants completed questionnaires, standardized psychometric tests, and neuropsychiatric interviews. Ayahuasca use in Estonia occurred mainly in (neo)shamanic group ceremonies. The main motives for ayahuasca use were spiritual development, self-knowledge, and spiritual experiences. The users reported mostly positive subjective consequences of ayahuasca use for their health and life. However, some difficult experiences and adverse effects were reported. No abuse of ayahuasca or addiction to it was found. Screening test indicators of depression and anxiety were lower in the ayahuasca-using group. No deterioration of the mental health of ayahuasca users in comparison to nonusers was found. The participants perceive their use of ayahuasca as a spiritual practice with mostly favorable outcomes for their health and life. They also perceive ayahuasca use in Estonia as a reasonably safe and self-limiting form of spiritual practice.",

        "Intravenous ketamine is an effective treatment of bipolar depression. One of its most important side-effects is a transient altered state of consciousness commonly referred to as dissociation. These states can be anxiety-provoking, distressing and even treatment-limiting, warranting research into mitigation strategies. In this article, we present two cases that demonstrate the potential of adjunctive music to diminish the distress associated with ketamine-induced dissociation - though not necessarily its degree - in bipolar 1 disorder. Both patients suffering from severe depression underwent their first ketamine infusion without music and opted for music with subsequent infusions. They reported that music significantly improved the tolerance of their dissociative symptoms, thereby reducing distress and facilitating subsequent treatments. Both patients achieved remission from their highly treatment-resistant depressive episodes following six ketamine infusions. This is the first report of music's benefits on ketamine for bipolar 1 depression, though there is precedence in the scientific literature on 'psychedelics' where the use of music in combination with medication-induced altered states has been studied. The principles regarding music selection that have resulted from this paradigm may be applicable to the use of ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression. The optimal use of music with ketamine warrants further research.",

        "The word \"psychedelic\" (psyche (i.e., the mind or soul) and delos (i.e., to show)) has Greek origin and was first coined by psychiatrist Humphry Osmond in 1956, who had been conducting research on lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at the time. Psychedelic drugs such as ,-DMT/DMT (,-dimethyltryptamine), 5-MeO-DMT (5-methoxy-,-dimethyltryptamine), LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and psilocybin have had significant value as an entheogen in spiritual, religious (shamanic) and sociocultural rituals in Central and South American cultures for thousands of years. In the 1960s, the globalization of these drugs and their subsequent spread outside of their indigenous, old-world cultures, led to the subsequent implementation of strict drug control laws in many Western countries. Even today, psychedelics are still classified as Schedule I drugs, resulting in a still lingering negative stigmatization/perception, vilification, and ultimate criminalization of psychedelics. This controversy still lingers and still limits scientific research and full medical acceptance. For many years up until recently, the spiritual, religious and medicinal value of these drugs could not be explored in a scientific context. More recently, a second wave of psychedelic research is now focusing on psychedelics as neuropharmaceuticals to treat alcohol and tobacco addiction, general mood and anxiety disorders and cancer-related depression. There is now a vast array of promising evidence-based data to confirm the years of anecdotal evidence of the medicinal values of psychedelics. Natural therapeutic alternatives such as psychedelic drugs may provide a safe and efficacious alternate to conventional drugs used to treat mood and anxiety disorders. In a Western context in particular, psychedelic drugs as therapeutic agents for mood and anxiety disorders are becoming increasingly of interest amidst increasing rates of such disorders globally, changing social constructions, the implementation of government regulations and increasing investment opportunities, that ultimately allow for the scientific study to generate evidenced-based data. Alternative psychotherapeutic interventions are gaining interest also, because of their low physiological toxicity, relatively low abuse potential, safe psychological effects, and no associated persisting adverse physiological or psychological effects during and after use. On the other hand, conventional psychotic drugs and anti-depressants are becoming less favorable because of their adverse side effects. Psychedelic neuropharmaceutical interventions may with medical oversight be the solution to conventional psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and an alternative to conventional psychiatric treatment options. This paper will review the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs as alternative therapeutic options for mood and anxiety disorders in a controlled, clinical setting, where the chances of adverse psychological episodes occurring are mitigated.

        "5-HTergic and GABAergic systems are involved in neurobiology of anxiety. Precedent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs possessed an anxiolytic-like effect in the four-plate test (FPT) at doses that did not modify spontaneous locomotor activity. This effect seems to be mediated through the activation of 5-HT(2A) postsynaptic receptors. The purpose of the present study was to examine the implication of GABA system in the anxiolytic-like activity of DOI in the FPT. To achieve this, the co-administration of DOI (5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonists) with GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor ligands was evaluated in the FPT. Alprazolam, diazepam and muscimol (for higher dose) potentiated the anxiolytic-like effect of DOI. Bicuculline, picrotoxin and baclofen inhibited the anxiolytic-like effect of DOI. Flumazenil and CGP 35348 had no effect on the anxiolytic-like activity of DOI. These results suggest that the GABA system seems to be strongly implicated in the anxiolytic-like activity of DOI in the FPT.",

        "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by abnormally persistent and distressing memories, is a chronic debilitating condition in need of new treatment options. Current treatment guidelines recommend psychotherapy as first line management with only two drugs, sertraline and paroxetine, approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of PTSD. These drugs have limited efficacy as they only reduce symptoms related to depression and anxiety without producing permanent remission. PTSD remains a significant public health problem with high morbidity and mortality requiring major advances in therapeutics. Early evidence has emerged for the beneficial effects of psychedelics particularly in combination with psychotherapy for management of PTSD, including psilocybin, MDMA, LSD, cannabinoids, ayahuasca and ketamine. MDMA and psilocybin reduce barrier to therapy by increasing trust between therapist and patient, thus allowing for modification of trauma related memories. Furthermore, research into the memory reconsolidation mechanisms has allowed for identification of various pharmacological targets to disrupt abnormally persistent memories. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have investigated novel and re-purposed pharmacological agents to disrupt fear memory in PTSD. Novel therapeutic approaches like neuropeptide Y, oxytocin, cannabinoids and neuroactive steroids have also shown potential for PTSD treatment. Here, we focus on the role of fear memory in the pathophysiology of PTSD and propose that many of these new therapeutic strategies produce benefits through the effect on fear memory. Evaluation of recent research findings suggests that while a number of drugs have shown promising results in preclinical studies and pilot clinical trials, the evidence from large scale clinical trials would be needed for these drugs to be incorporated in clinical practice.",

Harmane (2.5, 5.0, or 10 mg/kg, i.p.), saline, or imipramine were given 30 minutes before the tests. Administration of harmane decreased the time of immobility in the FST dose-dependently and increased the time spent in open arms in the EPM, as compared with the saline group.

        "There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca for treating depression and anxiety. However, the mechanisms of action involved in ayahuasca's therapeutic effects are unclear. Mindfulness and cognitive flexibility may be two possible psychological mechanisms. Like other classic psychedelics, ayahuasca also leads to an 'afterglow' effect of improved subjective well-being that persists after the acute effects have subsided. This period may offer a window of increased therapeutic potential. To explore changes in mindfulness and cognitive flexibility before and within 24 h after ayahuasca use. Forty-eight participants (54% female) were assessed on measures of mindfulness (Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)), and cognitive flexibility (Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS)), and completed the Stroop and Wisconsin Picture Card Sorting Task (WPCST) before drinking ayahuasca, and again within 24 h. Mindfulness (FFMQ total scores and four of the five mindfulness facets: observe, describe, act with awareness, and non-reactivity) and decentering (EQ) significantly increased in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Cognitive flexibility (CFS and WPCST) significantly improved in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Changes in both mindfulness and cognitive flexibility were not influenced by prior ayahuasca use. The present study supports ayahuasca's ability to enhance mindfulness and further reports changes in cognitive flexibility in the 'afterglow' period occur, suggesting both could be possible psychological mechanisms concerning the psychotherapeutic effects of ayahuasca. Given psychological gains occurred regardless of prior ayahuasca use suggests potentially therapeutic effects for both naive and experienced ayahuasca drinkers. ",

        "Accumulating clinical evidence shows that psychedelic therapy, by synergistically combining psychopharmacology and psychological support, offers a promising transdiagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and/or maladaptive habitual patterns of emotion, cognition and behavior, notably, depression (MDD), treatment resistant depression (TRD) and addiction disorders, but perhaps also anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and eating disorders. Despite the emergent transdiagnostic evidence, the specific clinical dimensions that psychedelics are efficacious for, and associated underlying neurobiological pathways, remain to be well-characterized. To this end, this review focuses on pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the acute and sustained therapeutic potential of psychedelic therapy in the context of a transdiagnostic dimensional systems framework. Focusing on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) as a template, we will describe the multimodal mechanisms underlying the transdiagnostic therapeutic effects of psychedelic therapy, traversing molecular, cellular and network levels. These levels will be mapped to the RDoC constructs of negative and positive valence systems, arousal regulation, social processing, cognitive and sensorimotor systems. In summarizing this literature and framing it transdiagnostically, we hope we can assist the field in moving toward a mechanistic understanding of how psychedelics work for patients and eventually toward a precise-personalized psychedelic therapy paradigm.",

        "We previously reported a novel psychobiotic strain of Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) which could ameliorate anxiety-like& depression-like behaviors and modulate cerebral dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in mice. Here, we examine the possibility of using PS128 administration to improve tic-like behaviors by using a 5-HT and 5-HT receptor agonist 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). PS128 was orally administered to male Wistar rat for 2 weeks before two daily DOI injections. We recorded the behaviors immediately after the second DOI injection and compared the results with control and haloperidol treatment groups. PS128 significantly reduced tic-like behaviors and pre-pulse inhibition deficit in a threshold-dose of 10 CFU per day. Brain tissue analysis showed that DOI induced abnormal DA efflux in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, while PS128 ingestion improved DA metabolism and increased norepinephrine (NE) levels in these two regions. In addition, PS128 ingestion increased DA transporter and b-arrestin expressions and decreased DOI-induced phosphorylation of DA and cAMP regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32 kDa (DARPP-32) at Thr34 and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK). PS128 ingestion also modulated peripheral 5-HT levels and shaped the cecal microbiota composition, which helps to alleviate DOI-induced dysbiosis. These results suggested that PS128 ameliorated DOI-induced tic-like hyper-active behaviors via stabilizing cerebral dopaminergic pathways through its modulation of host's microbiota-gut-brain axis. Thus, we believe there are potentials for utilizing psychobiotics to improve syndromes caused by DA dysregulation in DA-related neurological disorders and movement disorders such as Tourette syndrome.

        "Survey-based studies suggest naturalistic psychedelic use provides mental health benefits similar to those observed in clinical trials. The current study sought to confirm these findings in a large group of psychedelic users and to conduct a novel examination of associations between amount of psychedelic use and behavioral outcomes, as well as frequency of harms ascribed to psychedelic use. A cross-sectional, online survey was completed by 2,510 adults reporting at least one lifetime psychedelic experience. Participants retrospectively completed a battery of instruments assessing depression, anxiety, and emotional well-being prior to and following psychedelic exposure. Participants also reported preferred psychedelic agent, number of uses, and harms attributed to psychedelic use. Psychedelic use was associated with significant improvements in depressive and anxious symptoms and with increased emotional well-being. These improvements increased in magnitude with increasing psychedelic exposure, with a ceiling effect. However, improvements were noted following a single lifetime use. Strong evidence for benefit of one preferred psychedelic agent over another was not observed, but enduring increases in factors related to mystical-experience and prosocial perspective taking associated with enhanced mental health. Thirteen percent of the survey sample ( = 330) endorsed at least one harm from psychedelic use, and these participants reported less mental health benefit. Results from the current study add to a growing database indicating that psychedelic use-even outside the context of clinical trials-may provide a wide range of mental health benefits, while also posing some risk for harm in a minority of individuals.

In light of these findings surrounding ketamine's psychotherapeutic potential, we systematically review the extant evidence on ketamine's effects in treating mental health disorders. The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (identifier CRD42019130636). Human studies investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in the treatment of mental health disorders were included. Because of the extensive research in depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. We searched Medline and PsycINFO on 21 October 2020. Risk-of-bias analysis was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Checklist. We included 83 published reports in the final review: 33 systematic reviews, 29 randomised controlled trials, two randomised trials without placebo, three non-randomised trials with controls, six open-label trials and ten retrospective reviews. The results were presented via narrative synthesis. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide support for robust, rapid and transient antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine. Evidence for other indications is less robust, but suggests similarly positive and short-lived effects. The conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias of included studies. Optimal dosing, modes of administration and the most effective forms of adjunctive psychotherapeutic support should be examined further. ",

        "Psilocybin, the primary psychoactive component of psychedelic 'magic mushrooms', may have potential for treating depressive symptoms, and consequent applications for bipolar disorder (BD). Knowledge of the risks and benefits of psilocybin in BD is limited to case studies. To support the design of clinical trials, we surveyed experiences of psilocybin use in people with BD. An international web-based survey was used to explore experiences of psilocybin use in people with a self-reported diagnosis of BD. Quantitative findings were summarised using descriptive statistics. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate free-text responses, with a focus on positive experiences of psilocybin use. A total of 541 people completed the survey (46.4% female, mean 34.1 years old). One-third (32.2%;  = 174) of respondents described new/increasing symptoms after psilocybin trips, prominently manic symptoms, difficulties sleeping and anxiety. No differences in rates of adverse events overall were observed between individuals with BD I compared to BD II. Use of emergency medical services was rare ( = 18; 3.3%), and respondents (even those who experienced adverse effects) indicated that psilocybin use was more helpful than harmful. Quantitative findings elaborated on perceived benefits, as well as the potential for psilocybin trips to contain both positively and negatively received elements. The subjective benefits of psilocybin use for mental health symptoms reported by survey participants encourage further investigation of psilocybin-based treatments for BD. Clinical trials should incorporate careful monitoring of symptoms, as data suggest that BD symptoms may emerge or intensify following psilocybin use. ",

        "The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have led to significant changes in people's daily lives. This paper examines changes in substance use during the first lockdown (March-July 2020) and investigates mental health burdens in substance users with increased consumption of alcohol, nicotine or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in Germany compared to users with unchanged or reduced consumption. In a cross-sectional online survey, 2369 people were asked about their mental health and their substance use during the first lockdown in Germany. Of the participants, 28.5% increased their alcohol use, 28.8% their use of tobacco products, and 20.6% their use of THC-containing products during the pandemic. The groups with increased alcohol, nicotine, and THC use during the first lockdown reported more depressive symptoms and anxiety. Individuals who reported increased consumption of alcohol or nicotine were also more likely to experience loneliness and have suicidal thoughts and were more often stressed due to social distancing. Alcohol, nicotine and THC increased in a subgroup of consumers who reported to have more mental health problems compared to individuals who did not increase their consumption. This increased substance use could, therefore, be understood as a dysfunctional strategy to cope with negative emotions during the lockdown. ",

        "This article presents data from two avenues of marijuana research. First, the author shows that daily marijuana smoking in healthy individuals produces dependence, as demonstrated by withdrawal symptoms such as increased irritability and depression and decreased food intake. In addition, two antidepressant medications were evaluated to assess their potential effectiveness in the treatment of marijuana withdrawal symptoms: (1) sustained-release bupropion (0, 300 mg/day) and (2) nefazodone (0, 450 mg/day). Research participants were regular marijuana smokers who lived in a residential laboratory in groups of two to four. While inpatients, participants smoked active marijuana (2.8%-3.1% THC) repeatedly for 4 days, followed by 8 to 12 days of placebo marijuana (0.0% THC). Results show that during marijuana abstinence, (1) bupropion increased ratings of irritability, depression, and stomach pain and decreased food intake and sleep quality compared to placebo maintenance, and (2) nefazodone decreased anxiety during marijuana withdrawal but did not alter ratings of irritability and misery. Thus, neither medication showed promise as potential treatments for symptoms of marijuana withdrawal. The second avenue of research focused on the effect of cannabinoids in individuals with muscle mass loss, an indicator of wasting in HIV illness. Given that there are little scientific data contributing to the debates concerning medical marijuana, this study directly compared the effects of oral delta9-THC (0, 10, 20, 30 mg PO) to smoked marijuana (0.0%, 1.8%, 2.8%, 3.9% THC) in HIV + marijuana smokers with muscle mass loss (< 90% body cell mass/height). Multiple dimensions of human behavior were measured, including food intake, mood, and cognitive performance. Drugs were administered using a within-subject, double-blind, staggered, double-dummy design. Participants were free to self-select from a variety of foods throughout most of the session. Preliminary data (n = 9) suggest that oral THC was more effective at increasing food intake, but the volunteers \"liked\" the effects of smoked marijuana more than the effects of oral THC.",

        "During the last decades a new landscape of cannabis has been designed on account of: the increase in its use the greater youth of its users; the increase in the content of its main active constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and a lot of new epidemiological and neurobiological data. THC displays an exceptional lipophilicity, allowing its cerebral storage, leading to long lasting effects, by far more lasting than its presence in blood, and beyond the period throughout the intoxicated people feel a disablement. This is linked to its slow release from brain areas in which large proportion of spare receptors exists (reserve receptors). THC disturbs cognition and various skills required in driving. It may be responsible for psychiatric troubles: anxiety, depression, suicide attempt, psychotic attack, triggering of schizophrenia. It potentiates the alcohol effects and incites to alcohol drinking. It displays close relationships with dependence to heroin. This new landscape of cannabis urges to make a radical alteration in the public communication about this drug of abuse as it has yet collected so many troubles, accidents or tragedies.",

Recent studies have proven the therapeutic potential of some psychedelic compounds to safely treat a wide range of diseases such as anxiety, depression, migraine, and addiction. It is hypothesized that psychedelic compounds like tryptamines can exert their effects by two possible mechanisms: binding to the transmembrane serotonin receptor and/or modifying the properties of the neuronal membrane that can alter the conformational equilibrium and desensitize receptors. The impact of three different tryptamine class compounds with a tertiary amine (dimethyltryptamine, bufotenine, and 5-MeO-DMT) in both neutral and charged forms on a model bilayer lipid membrane are studied using all-atom MD simulations. All compounds partition into the bilayer, and change membrane properties, but to different extents. We determine the tendency of compounds to partition into the membrane by free energy calculations. Neutral tryptamines partition into the bilayer almost completely. Dimethyltryptamine and 5-MeO-DMT cross the membrane spontaneously during the simulation time, but bufotenine does not, although it has the maximum effect on the structural properties of the membrane. However, protonated compounds partition partially into the bilayer and cannot pass through the middle of the membrane during the simulation time. In this way, subtle alteration of chemical structure can play a significant role in the improvement or deterioration of partitioning of these compounds into the bilayer and their passage across the membrane.",

        "The recreational drugs, alcohol and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\") have both been shown to cause immune activation in vivo, and they are linked to cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behaviors in rodents. The neuronal effects of these drugs in the hippocampal area, an area that has been a focus of studies aiming to explain the mechanisms underlying anxiety related-disorders, remains poorly understood. Therefore we investigated the specific inflammatory impact of alcohol and MDMA on this area of the brain and on a hippocampal-related behavioral task. We centered our study on two inflammatory factors linked to anxiety-related disorders, namely Interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We subjected drug-consuming mice to a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate general activity, anxiety-like and depressive-live behaviors. We then introduced them to a contextual fear discrimination task and immune-related effects were examined by immunohistochemical and biochemical studies. Our results suggest that there is a relationship between the induction of immune activated pathways by voluntary alcohol consumption and a high-dose MDMA. Furthermore, the ability of mice to perform a contextual fear discrimination task was impaired by drug consumption and we report long term inflammatory alterations in the hippocampus even several weeks after drug intake. This information will be helpful for discovering new selective drug targets, and to develop treatments and preventive approaches for patients with anxiety-related disorders.",

        "Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are phytocannabinoids being linked with modulation of anxiety and depression. The recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE) is impaired in these disorders. Both drugs could modulate anxiety and mood by interfering with REFE. Thus, a systematic review of controlled trials assessing the effects of THC and CBD on REFE was performed. Ten studies describing seven distinct experiments were found (n = 170). THC (7.5-15 mg) did not alter REFE in three experiments, but reduced task performance in other three experiments. CBD did not alter REFE in two experiments, but improved task performance and counteracted the effects of THC in one experiment. THC (>= 10 mg) and CBD (600 mg) showed opposite effects on brain activation, skin conductance, and anxiety measures with negative/threatening faces. The limited number of studies precludes firm conclusions on the effects of these substances on REFE. Further controlled trials are needed to elucidate the effects of THC and CBD on REFE. The PROSPERO ID for this study is CRD42019135085.",

        "Psychedelic microdosing describes the ingestion of near-threshold perceptible doses of classic psychedelic substances. Anecdotal reports and observational studies suggest that microdosing may promote positive mood and well-being, but recent placebo-controlled studies failed to find compelling evidence for this. The present study collected web-based mental health and related data using a prospective (before, during and after) design. Individuals planning a weekly microdosing regimen completed surveys at strategic timepoints, spanning a core four-week test period. Eighty-one participants completed the primary study endpoint. Results revealed increased self-reported psychological well-being, emotional stability and reductions in state anxiety and depressive symptoms at the four-week primary endpoint, plus increases in psychological resilience, social connectedness, agreeableness, nature relatedness and aspects of psychological flexibility. However, positive expectancy scores at baseline predicted subsequent improvements in well-being, suggestive of a significant placebo response. This study highlights a role for positive expectancy in predicting positive outcomes following psychedelic microdosing and cautions against zealous inferences on its putative therapeutic value.",

        "5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HTR) agonist psychedelics are increasingly recognized as potentially useful treatments of psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, and drug dependence. There is limited understanding of the way they exert their therapeutic action, but inhibition of rigid behavior and cognition has been suggested as a key factor. To examine the role of 5-HTRs in modulating repetitive behavior, we tested two 5-HTR agonists, DOI, and the selective 25CN-NBOH, in two mouse tests of compulsive-like behavior. Using adult C57BL/6JOlaHsd male mice, we examined the effects of the two compounds on digging behavior in the marble burying test and on 8-OH-DPAT-disrupted spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze. Both compounds dose-dependently decreased digging behavior in the marble burying test, indicating anti-compulsivity effects, which were not related to non-specific locomotor inhibition. Both 5-HTR agonists also reversed 8-OH-DPAT-reduced alternation ratio in the spontaneous alternation behavior test, although the effects were less pronounced than in the marble burying test. This suggests that the 5-HTR promotes exploratory behavior, but that the deficit produced by 8-OH-DPAT is too excessive to be fully reversed by 5-HTR agonists. This study shows that agonism of 5-HTR reduces repetitive behavioral patterns, supporting the theory that this is a potential new treatment approach to disorders of cognitive or behavioral inflexibility.

        "Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic found in \"magic mushrooms\" with a putative therapeutic potential for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and addiction. In rodents, psilocybin acutely induces plasticity-related immediate early genes in cortical tissue; however, studies into the effects on subcortical regions, of different doses, and the subsequent translation of corresponding proteins are lacking. We examined the acute effects of a single administration of psilocybin (0.5-20 mg/kg) on the expression of selected genes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In total, 46 target genes and eight reference genes were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Corresponding protein levels of the three most commonly regulated genes were assessed using Western blotting. In the prefrontal cortex, psilocybin increased the expression of , , , , , , , , , and , and decreased the expression of . In the hippocampus, psilocybin strongly increased the expression of , , , and  in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased the expression of , , , and . Protein levels of Sgk1, Dusp1, and Ikb-a showed only partial agreement with transcriptional patterns, stressing the importance of assessing downstream translation when investigating rapid gene responses. The present study demonstrates that psilocybin rapidly induces gene expression related to neuroplasticity, biased towards the prefrontal cortex, compared to the hippocampus. Our findings provide further evidence for the rapid plasticity-promoting effects of psilocybin. ",

        "Emerging evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggests psychedelic compounds such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), when administered as an adjunct to psychotherapy, that is, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP), may be beneficial for treating substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions. Previous ethnopsychopharmacological research has identified ethnoracial differences in the metabolism, safety, and efficacy of psychotropic drugs, yet no studies have directly investigated the impact of ethnoracially based differences in psychedelic drug pharmacology. Although there is an extensive global history of psychedelic use among peoples of various cultures, ethnicities, and intersectional identities, psychedelic research has been conducted almost exclusively on White populations in North America and Western Europe. The failure to include Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in psychedelic research trials neglects the ethnic, racial, and cultural factors that may impact individual responses to PAP and thereby prevents generalizability of findings. This article investigates the impact of biological and social factors related to culture, ethnicity, and race on pharmacological responses to PAP, as well as clinical outcomes. The limitations of ethnopsychopharmacology are discussed, and the authors present expected cultural, clinical, and public health benefits of expanding funding for this area. This work will draw attention to the unique and individualized needs of ethnoracially diverse clients in therapeutic settings and is intended to inform future PAP trials.

        "'Hidden' symptoms, or subtle cognitive deficits and long-term changes in mood, have been linked to the recreational use of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine/MDMA, and are notionally present in non-heavy polydrug users. This study assessed the cognitive functioning and mood profiles of clinically diagnosed drug dependents who had never consumed MDMA, recreational drug users that had previously consumed MDMA, with both groups having not consumed illicit drugs for 6-months, and a control group with limited illicit drug use and no MDMA usage in their past. Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Cognitive Drug Research computerised cognitive assessment system and participants completed the Profile of Mood States and Beck Depression Inventory to assess their current mood and depression. Participants in the clinically diagnosed drug dependent group scored significantly worse on the 'Quality of Working Memory' cognitive factor score than both the MDMA and control group (F (2, 33) = 5.75, p = 0.007). The control and clinical groups also differed on depression scores (U [16] = 13.00, p = 0.016) and Tension/Anxiety scores (U [16] = 16.00, p = 0.034), with the clinical group scoring significantly higher in both cases. The MDMA group did not differ from the control group on the measures of cognition or mood. These results suggest that despite a 6-month prolonged abstinence the cognitive deficits ostensibly caused by 'heavy' usage or the dependence on or abuse of illicit drugs are not reversed by abstinence.

        "After a cessation of almost 40 years, there is renewed interest into therapeutic applicationsof the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin for the treatment of patients with various psychiatric disorders. PubMed was searched for clinical trials into \"psilocybin\" between 2000 and 2020, complemented by handsearching. Articles were also screened for explanatory models and working mechanisms. Psilocybin has been studied in 9 clinical trials: for the treatment of substance use disorders, depression, end-of-life anxiety, demoralization, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Results show that psilocybin is well tolerated, with only limited side-effects, while even patients with treatment-resistant disorders sometimes show marked, long-term improvements after one or a few sessions. Initial results are encouraging, but there are several limitations. More research is needed to determine which patient populations can benefit, what role setting and the placebo response play, and how these novel treatments can be optimized.",

The recent FDA approval of esketamine for adults with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) has further underscored the relevance of this agent in spurring investigation into novel and mechanistically distinct agents for use in depression. Over the past two decades, ketamine research has ushered in a new wave of studies seeking to not only identify its mechanism of action but also to examine the antidepressant potential of novel or repurposed agents.

        "Salvia divinorum has known hallucinogenic effects and is legal in most parts of the United States. Given that this psychoactive substance has a potential of misuse and abuse, further data regarding the clinical and psychosocial factors associated with use are needed. To examine the clinical and psychosocial characteristics associated with use of salvia. The study uses data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2008 (N = 55,623). The results of this study suggest that salvia use is most common among young adults aged 18-25 years as well as individuals who had engaged in risk-taking behaviors (selling illicit drugs, stealing) or illicit drug use (especially other hallucinogens/ecstasy). Self-reported depression and anxiety were also associated with salvia use. CONCLUSIONS/SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: The results provide evidence that salvia use is part of a broader constellation of psychosocial and behavioral problems among youth and young adults. The accessibility, legal status, and psychoactive effects of salvia can be a potentially complicating health risk to young people, especially among those with existing substance use problems. ",

        "Noncardiac chest pain is associated with poor quality of life and high care expenditure. The majority of noncardiac chest pain is either gastresophageal reflux disease related or due to esophageal motility disorders, and the rest are considered functional chest pain (FCP) due to central and peripheral hypersensitivity. Current treatment of FCP improves 40-50% of patients. Cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2) modulate release of neurotransmitters; CB1 is located in the esophageal epithelium and reduces excitatory enteric transmission and potentially could reduce esophageal hypersensitivity. We performed a prospective study to evaluate its effects on pain threshold, frequency, and intensity in FCP. Subjects with FCP received dronabinol (5 mg, twice daily; n = 7; average age, 44 years; mean body mass index, 26.7) or placebo (n = 6; average age, 42 years; mean body mass index, 25.9) for 28 days (4 weeks). Chest pain, general health, and anxiety/depression questionnaires were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Subjects underwent an esophageal balloon distention test prior to treatment and on last day of the study. Dronabinol increased pain thresholds significantly (3.0 vs. 1.0; P = 0.03) and reduced pain intensity and odynophagia compared to placebo (0.18 vs. 0.01 and 0.12 vs. 0.01, respectively, P = 0.04). Depression and anxiety scores did not differ between the groups at baseline or after treatment. No significant adverse effects were observed. In this novel study, dronabinol increased pain threshold and reduced frequency and intensity of pain in FCP. Further, large scale studies are needed to substantiate these findings.",

        "The origin of the psychiatric illnesses observed in drug abusers is often unclear. This study examines the causal relation between drug abuse and specific psychiatric disorders. Fifty-one male veterans first seen in 1972, who were admitted at least once per year for six consecutive years for inpatient drug-abuse treatment, underwent psychiatric assessments at each admission. Eleven men mainly used stimulants, 14 depressants, and 26 opiates. Initial psychiatric examinations showed low symptom levels in all groups but no statistically significant differences among them. By the end of six years, five of the stimulant users had psychoses, and eight of the depressant users had serious depression. The narcotics users showed no change in psychopathology. Differences between the groups were significant at the 0.01 level. These changes were not due to acute toxic reactions, but our data suggest that abuse of particular drugs has a major role in the development of specific psychiatric illnesses. The possibility that different preexisting personality disorders lead to different kinds of drug abuse cannot be excluded.",

        "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used in psychiatric and psychological research and investigated as a potential treatment for medical and psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and cluster headache. Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples. We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. We conducted a pooled analysis of four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single-dose administrations of LSD. LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies. Single doses were 25, 50, 100, and 200 ug of LSD base. We investigated subjective effects (self-rated any drug effect, good drug effect, bad drug effect, and anxiety), blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, duration of the acute LSD response, acute (12 h) and subacute (24 h) adverse effects, reports of flashbacks, and liver and kidney function before and after the studies. LSD dose-dependently increased subjective, physiologic, and adverse effects. The dose-response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects. Maximal ratings of > 50% good drug effects were reached in 37%, 91%, 96%, and 91% of the LSD administrations at 25, 50, 100, and 200 ug. Maximal ratings of > 50% bad drug effects were reached in 0%, 9%, 27%, 31% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 ug, respectively. Mean ratings of Oceanic Boundlessness were 10%, 25%, 41%, and 44%, and mean ratings of Anxious Ego-Dissolution were 3.4%, 13%, 20%, and 22% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 ug, respectively. The physiologic effects of LSD were moderate. None of the subjects had systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg at any time. Peak heart rate > 100 beats/min was observed in 0%, 6%, 20%, and 25% of the subjects at 25, 50, 100, and 200 ug, respectively. Maximal heart rates of 129 and 121 beats/min were observed in one subject at the 50 and 200 ug doses, respectively. Peak body temperature > 38deg was observed in 0%, 11%, 7%, and 34% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 ug, respectively. Mean acute adverse effect scores on the List of Complaints were 5.6, 9.2, 12, and 13 at 25, 50, 100, and 200 ug, respectively. Kidney and liver function parameters were unaltered. Six subjects reported transient flashback phenomena. The single-dose administration of LSD is safe in regard to acute psychological and physical harm in healthy subjects in a controlled research setting. ",

        "Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms during childhood and adolescence have been associated with greater risk of later ecstasy use. Ecstasy users have reported using ecstasy to reduce depression or worry, or to escape. While these findings suggest that some people use ecstasy as a form of self-medication, limited research has been conducted examining the relationship between affective symptoms, coping styles and drug use motives in ecstasy users. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine if coping style and/or ecstasy use motives are associated with current mood symptoms in ecstasy users. A community sample (n=184) of 18-35 year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12 months completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, ecstasy use motives and coping styles. Timeline follow back methods were used to collect information on lifetime ecstasy, recent drug use and life stress. Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List. Coping motives for ecstasy use and an emotion-focused coping style were significantly associated with current depressive and anxiety symptoms. Emotion-focused coping mediated the relationship between a history of trauma and current anxiety symptoms and moderated the relationship between recent stressful life events and current depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of interventions targeting motives for ecstasy use, and providing coping skills training for managing stressful life events among people with co-occurring depressive/anxiety symptoms and ecstasy use.

        "5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is a psychotropic substance found in various plant and animal species and is synthetically produced. 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is used in naturalistic settings for spiritual exploration, recreation, or to address negative affect and mood problems. However, scientific knowledge on the effects of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans is scarce. The first objective was to assess the effects of inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine on neuroendocrine markers. The second objective was to assess effects of the substance on affect and mindfulness. In addition, we assessed whether ratings of subjective measures were associated with changes in stress biomarkers (i.e., cortisol) and immune response (i.e., IL-6, CRP, IL-1b), as well as the acute psychedelic experience. Assessments (baseline, immediately post-session, and 7-day follow-up) were made in 11 participants. Salivary samples were collected at baseline and post-session and analyzed by high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine significantly increased cortisol levels and decreased IL-6 concentrations in saliva immediately post-session. These changes were not correlated to ratings of mental health or the psychedelic experience. Relative to baseline, ratings of non-judgment significantly increased, and ratings of depression decreased immediately post-session and at follow-up. Ratings of anxiety and stress decreased from baseline to 7-day follow-up. Participant ratings of the psychedelic experience correlated negatively with ratings of affect and positively with ratings of non-judgment. Inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine produced significant changes in inflammatory markers, improved affect, and non-judgment in volunteers. Future research should examine the effect of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamineamine with healthy volunteers in a controlled laboratory setting. ",

        "Psilocybin, a classic hallucinogen, is a chemical produced by more than 100 species of mushrooms worldwide. It has high affinity for several serotonin receptors, including 5-HT, 5-HT, and 5-HT, located in numerous areas of the brain, including the cerebral cortex and thalamus. With legislation introduced in 1992, more work is being done to further understand the implications of psilocybin use in a number of disease states. Certain mental health disease states and symptoms have been studied, including depressed mood, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and tobacco use disorder. This article provides an in-depth review of the study design and results of psilocybin in each of these conditions and discusses the clinical potential for use. ",

        "A resurgence of research investigating the administration of psychedelic compounds alongside psychotherapy suggests that this treatment is a promising intervention for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with cancer. However, psychedelic treatment that induces a mind-altering experience potentially poses barriers to vulnerable cancer patients, and health-care practitioners may have concerns about referring their patients to trials investigating this approach. The aim of the current study was to investigate the perceptions of cancer health-care practitioners based in New Zealand and the USA related to psychedelic-assisted therapy. This study utilized a cross-sectional survey of cancer health-care practitioners in New Zealand and the USA via convenience sampling to identify their perceptions about the concept of conducting psychedelic-assisted therapy with cancer patients. Participants perceived that (1) psychedelic-assisted therapy has the potential to provide benefit for cancer patients, (2) research in this area across a variety of domains is important, (3) work should consider spiritual and indigenous perspectives of health, and (4) there was willingness to refer patients to trials in this area, especially patients with advanced disease who were no longer going through curative treatment. Participants in the USA had greater awareness of psychedelics than the New Zealand sample; however, New Zealand participants more strongly believed that spiritual/indigenous factors should be considered in psychedelic-assisted therapy. Cancer health-care practitioners in our sample considered research investigating the potential for psychedelic-assisted therapies to be important and may be more open to studies that start in palliative and end-of-life contexts.

Secondary measures included ratings of altered states of consciousness and ego dissolution during the ayahuasca ceremony as well as global measures of mindfulness, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety, and stress. Twenty participants completed baseline and 1-day follow-up, 19 completed measures at 1-month follow-up, and 17 completed measures at 1-year follow-up. BDI scores reduced from baseline (M = 22.7) to all post-ceremony measures (Ms 11.45, 12.89, and 8.88, for 1-day, 1-month, and 1-year follow-up, respectively). After 1 day, 12/20 participants were in remission (BDI < 13). Remission rates after 1 month and 1 year were 13/19 and 12/17, respectively. Three participants remained mildly depressed (BDI 14-19) at the 1-month and 1-year follow-up. Two participants did not respond and remained at a moderate/severe level of depression at 1-year follow-up. Reductions on the secondary mental health measures and increases in mindfulness and satisfaction with life were found up to 1 year post-ceremony. Improvements in clinical depression and mental health correlated with levels of experienced ego dissolution and oceanic boundlessness during the ceremony up to 1 month after the ceremony. Engagement in additional mental health treatments or use of another psychedelic during study participation may have contributed to improved mental health ratings at 1-year follow-up. Ayahuasca produces long-term mental health improvements in clinically depressed patients, which highlights its therapeutic potential. ",

        "Residual effects of ecstasy use induce neurotransmitter changes that make it biologically plausible that extended use of the drug may induce psychological distress. However, there has been only mixed support for this in the literature. The presence of polysubstance use is a confounding factor. The aim of this study was to investigate whether regular cannabis and/or regular methamphetamine use confers additional risk of poor mental health and high levels of psychological distress, beyond regular ecstasy use alone. Three years of data from a yearly, cross-sectional, quantitative survey of Australian regular ecstasy users was examined. Participants were divided into four groups according to whether they regularly (at least monthly) used ecstasy only (n=936), ecstasy and weekly cannabis (n=697), ecstasy and weekly methamphetamine (n=108) or ecstasy, weekly cannabis and weekly methamphetamine (n=180). Self-reported mental health problems and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) were examined. Approximately one-fifth of participants self-reported at least one mental health problem, most commonly depression and anxiety. The addition of regular cannabis and/or methamphetamine use substantially increases the likelihood of self-reported mental health problems, particularly with regard to paranoia, over regular ecstasy use alone. Regular cannabis use remained significantly associated with self reported mental health problems even when other differences between groups were accounted for. Regular cannabis and methamphetamine use was also associated with earlier initiation to ecstasy use. These findings suggest that patterns of drug use can help identify at risk groups that could benefit from targeted approaches in education and interventions. Given that early initiation to substance use was more common in those with regular cannabis and methamphetamine use and given that this group had a higher likelihood of mental health problems, work around delaying onset of initiation should continue to be a priority.

        "Simultaneous polydrug use (SPU) may represent a greater incremental risk factor for human health than concurrent polydrug use (CPU). However, few studies have examined these patterns of use in relation to health issues, particularly with regard to the number of drugs used. In the present study, we have analyzed data from a representative sample of 5734 young Swiss males from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors. Exposure to drugs (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and 15 other illicit drugs), as well as mental, social and physical factors, were studied through regression analysis. We found that individuals engaging in CPU and SPU followed the known stages of drug use, involving initial experiences with licit drugs (e.g., alcohol and tobacco), followed by use of cannabis and then other illicit drugs. In this regard, two classes of illicit drugs were identified, including first uppers, hallucinogens and sniffed drugs; and then \"harder\" drugs (ketamine, heroin, and crystal meth), which were only consumed by polydrug users who were already taking numerous drugs. Moreover, we observed an association between the number of drugs used simultaneously and social issues (i.e., social consequences and aggressiveness). In fact, the more often the participants simultaneously used substances, the more likely they were to experience social problems. In contrast, we did not find any relationship between SPU and depression, anxiety, health consequences, or health. We identified some associations with SPU that were independent of CPU. Moreover, we found that the number of concurrently used drugs can be a strong factor associated with mental and physical health, although their simultaneous use may not significantly contribute to this association. Finally, the negative effects related to the use of one substance might be counteracted by the use of an additional substance. ",

        "Our creativity is challenged daily when facing new situations asking for novel solutions. Creativity, a multicomponent construct includes flexible divergent and rigid convergent thinking. Psychedelic drugs like psilocybin can enhance creativity and affect state of mind (mood, empathy, openness). Of note, flexible thinking is disturbed in psychopathological conditions like anxiety disorders and depression and preliminary findings have shown psychedelics to be efficacious in the treatment of those conditions. The question how psychedelics induce this state of enhanced flexible thinking remains to be answered and investigating the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon will not only help in understanding why psychedelics are of use in the therapeutic setting but also in other settings where flexible thinking is challenged. A model including neuronal networks, neurotransmitters and personal factors playing a role in this process will be proposed which can be put to the test by means of placebo-controlled pharmaco-imaging studies in healthy volunteers.",

        "A growing body of evidence shows that existential and spiritual well-being in cancer patients is associated with better medical outcomes, improved quality of life, and serves as a buffer against depression, hopelessness, and desire for hastened death. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in treating cancer-related anxiety and depression. A double-blind controlled trial was performed, where 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned to treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin in conjunction with psychotherapy. Previously published results of this trial demonstrated that, in conjunction with psychotherapy, moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust, and enduring anxiolytic, and anti-depressant effects. Here, we illustrate unique clinical courses described by four participants using quantitative measures of acute and persisting effects of psilocybin, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and spiritual well-being, as well as qualitative interviews, written narratives, and clinician notes. Although the content of each psilocybin-assisted experience was unique to each participant, several thematic similarities and differences across the various sessions stood out. These four participants' personal narratives extended beyond the cancer diagnosis itself, frequently revolving around themes of self-compassion and love, acceptance of death, and memories of past trauma, though the specific details or narrative content differ substantially. The results presented here demonstrate the personalized nature of the subjective experiences elicited through treatment with psilocybin, particularly with respect to the spiritual and/or psychological needs of each patient.",

        "Psychiatric research in the 1950s and 1960s showed potential for psychedelic medications to markedly alleviate depression and suffering associated with terminal illness. More recent published studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine when administered in a medically supervised and monitored approach. A single or brief series of sessions often results in substantial and sustained improvement among people with treatment-resistant depression and anxiety, including those with serious medical conditions. Need and Clinical Considerations: Palliative care clinicians occasionally encounter patients with emotional, existential, or spiritual suffering, which persists despite optimal existing treatments. Such suffering may rob people of a sense that life is worth living. Data from Oregon show that most terminally people who obtain prescriptions to intentionally end their lives are motivated by non-physical suffering. This paper overviews the history of this class of drugs and their therapeutic potential. Clinical cautions, adverse reactions, and important steps related to safe administration of psychedelics are presented, emphasizing careful patient screening, preparation, setting and supervision. Even with an expanding evidence base confirming safety and benefits, political, regulatory, and industry issues impose challenges to the legitimate use of psychedelics. The federal expanded access program and right-to-try laws in multiple states provide precendents for giving terminally ill patients access to medications that have not yet earned FDA approval. Given the prevalence of persistent suffering and growing acceptance of physician-hastened death as a medical response, it is time to revisit the legitimate therapeutic use of psychedelics. ",

        "Recreational lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) use is growing in popularity amid increasing research interest on psychedelics and their possible therapeutic potential yet; the potent psychotropic effects of LSD may result in adverse reactions and behaviour. This study aimed to investigate the 12-month incidence and nature of LSD-related adverse experiences resulting in emergency medical treatment (EMT) seeking in an international sample of people reporting LSD use. We use data from the 2017 Global Drug Survey - a large anonymous online survey on patterns of drug use conducted between November 2016 and January 2017. Out of 10,293 past-year LSD users, 102 (1.0%) reported seeking EMT, with a per-event risk estimate of 0.2%. Younger age, comorbid mental health conditions and higher frequency of use were associated with increased risk of EMT seeking. The most common symptoms were psychological, including anxiety, panic and confusion, with the most common explanatory factors cited by respondents being poor 'setting' and 'mindset'. Most responders reported feeling back to normal within 24 h, but 11 participants experienced persistent issues after 4 weeks. The results suggest that LSD is a relatively safe drug in recreational settings. Adverse reactions are typically short-lived, self-limiting and psychological in nature. Sub-optimal set and setting were commonly reported as suspected contributory factors. Within clinical settings, patient screening, preparatory sessions and supervision should reduce these acute risks considerably. ",

        "Central nervous system (CNS) damage associated with psychostimulant dependence may be an ongoing, degenerative process with adverse effects on neuropsychiatric function. However, the molecular mechanisms regarding how altered energy regulation affects immune response in the context of substance use disorders are not fully understood. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the effects of psychostimulant [particularly 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine] exposure on brain energy regulation, immune response, and neuropsychiatric function. Importantly, the neuropsychiatric impairments (e.g., cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety) that persist following abstinence are associated with poorer treatment outcomes - increased relapse rates, lower treatment retention rates, and reduced daily functioning. Qualifying the molecular changes within the CNS according to the exposure and use patterns of specifically abused substances should inform the development of new therapeutic approaches for addiction treatment.",

        "Genetic susceptibility to substance use disorders (SUDs) is partially shared between substances. Heritability of any substance dependence, estimated as 54%, is partly explained by additive effects of common variants. Comorbidity between SUDs and other psychiatric disorders is frequent. The present study aims to analyze the additive role of common variants in this comorbidity using polygenic scores (PGSs) based on genome-wide association study discovery samples of schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders, available from large consortia. PGSs were calculated for 534 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for dependence of a substance and abuse/dependence of another substance between alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, opiates, hypnotics, stimulants, hallucinogens and solvents; and 587 blood donors from the same population, Iberians from Galicia, as controls. Significance of the PGS and percentage of variance explained were calculated by logistic regression. Using discovery samples of similar size, significant associations with SUDs were detected for SCZ PGS. SCZ PGS explained more variance in SUDs than in most psychiatric disorders. Cross-disorder PGS based on five psychiatric disorders was significant after adjustment for the effect of SCZ PGS. SCZ PGS was significantly higher in women than in men abusing alcohol. Our findings indicate that SUDs share genetic susceptibility with SCZ to a greater extent than with other psychiatric disorders, including externalizing disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Women have lower probability to develop substance abuse/dependence than men at similar PGS probably because of a higher social pressure against excessive drug use in women.",

        "The widely used recreational drugs 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) and 3,4-methylenedioxyethamphetamine (MDE, Eve) occupy an intermediate position between stimulants and hallucinogens. Besides stimulation similar to that caused by amphetamines, they usually induce a pleasant, easily controllable emotional state with relaxation, fearlessness and feelings of happiness, but they sometimes also have stronger, hallucinogenic, effects. A number of pharmacological studies support the hypothesis that these drugs make up a distinct class of psychoactive substances, which have been designated \"entactogens.\" On the drug scene, MDMA and MDE are considered \"safe.\" However, this view must be corrected. Complications are rare, but potentially devastating ([long-lasting anxiety and depressive syndromes in chronic users, fatalities with hyperpyrexia, rhabdomyolysis and DIC syndrome (disseminated instravascular coagulation), possible hepatotoxicity]. Moreover, the clinical relevance of animal studies showing neurotoxic effects of MDMA on central serotonergic pathways is still not clear.",

        "The endocannabinoid (EC) system is widely distributed throughout the brain and modulates many functions. It is involved in mood and related disorders, and its activity may be modified by exogenous cannabinoids. This article examines the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in psychiatric disorders. An overview is presented of the literature focussed on the functions of the EC system, its dysfunction in mood disorders and the therapeutic potential of exogenous cannabinoids. We propose (hypothesize) that the EC system, which is homoeostatic in cortical excitation and inhibition, is dysfunctional in mood and related disorders. Anandamide, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) variously combine antidepressant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, analgesic, anticonvulsant actions, suggesting a therapeutic potential in mood and related disorders. Currently, cannabinoids find a role in pain control. Post mortem and other studies report EC system abnormalities in depression, schizophrenia and suicide. Abnormalities in the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CNR1) gene that codes for cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors are reported in psychiatric disorders. However, efficacy trials of cannabinoids in psychiatric disorders are limited but offer some encouragement. Research is needed to elucidate the role of the EC system in psychiatric disorders and for clinical trials with THC, CBD and synthetic cannabinoids to assess their therapeutic potential. ",

        "Cancer is highly prevalent and one of the leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Psychological and existential suffering is common in cancer patients, associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Promising early-phase clinical research (1960s to early 1970s) suggested a therapeutic signal for serotoninergic psychedelics (e.g. psilocybin, LSD) in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress. After several decades of quiescence, research on psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat psychiatric disorders in cancer patients has resumed within the last 2 decades in the US and Europe. This review article is based on a systematic search of clinical trials from 1960-2018 researching the therapeutic use of psychedelic treatment in patients with serious or terminal illnesses and related psychiatric illness. The search found 10 eligible clinical trials, with a total of 445 participants, with the vast majority of the patients having advanced or terminal cancer diagnoses. Six open label trials, published between 1964 and 1980 ( = 341), suggested that psychedelic therapy (mostly with LSD) may improve cancer-related depression, anxiety, and fear of death. Four RCTs trials were published between 2011 and 2016 ( = 104), mostly with psilocybin treatment ( = 92), and demonstrated that psychedelic-assisted treatment can produce rapid, robust, and sustained improvements in cancer-related psychological and existential distress.

        "Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder related to hypo-functioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission. N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDA-R) positive modulators were reported to reduce schizophrenia symptoms. However, their efficacy is low and inconsistent. We developed a novel antipsychotic possessing an olanzapine moiety linked to the positive modulator of glutamate NMDA-R sarcosine (PGW5) and characterized the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel molecule in-vivo using MK-801 and in-vitro using receptor binding analysis. We investigated the pharmacological activity of PGW5 (olanzapine linked to sarcosinyl moiety) in male mice (BALB/c or C57BL). In an open field test, up to 50mg/kg PGW5 did not affect motility while higher doses were sedative. PGW5 (25-50mg/kg po) antagonized MK-801 (0.15 mg/kg ip) and amphetamine-induced (5mg/kg ip) hyperactivity. PGW5 (25mg/kg po/d) treatment for 15 or 22 days exhibited antidepressant and anxiolytic activity in mice. Moreover, PGW5, but not olanzapine, attenuated phencyclidine (PCP)-induced deficits of social preference in mice and promoted the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in the hippocampus. Mice treated with PGW5 (25 and 50mg/kg/d) for 28 days did not show toxic effects in terms of weight gain and blood-chemistry analysis. PGW5 is a novel and safe antipsychotic, efficacious against schizophrenia-like positive and negative symptoms at nonsedative doses. The drug shows anxiolytic and antidepressant activity, and improves impaired social performance in phencyclidine (PCP) treated mice. The mechanism underlying its activity seems to involve potentiation of NMDA receptor as well as stimulation of brain BDNF and GAD67 expression. ",

        "Microdosing psychedelics is the repeated use of small doses of, for example, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, typically for a few weeks. Despite the popular and scientific attention in recent years, and claims by users that it has therapeutic value in affective disorders like depression, little scientific knowledge is available to back this. The purpose of this review was to investigate whether there are scientific grounds to state that this practice could be helpful in the treatment of affective disorders, and safe to use repeatedly. To that end, the literature (PubMed, MedLine) was searched, looking for (controlled) experimental studies with low doses of LSD and/or psilocybin, in healthy volunteers and patient samples. After a selection process and the addition of relevant articles, 14 experimental studies entered this review. Findings show that both LSD (10-20 mcg) and psilocybin (<1-3 mg) have subtle (positive) effects on cognitive processes (time perception, convergent and divergent thinking) and brain regions involved in affective processes. Besides the pleasant experience, increased anxiety and a cycling pattern of depressive and euphoric mood were also found. With regard to safety, it was demonstrated that low doses are well tolerated (in healthy volunteers) and have no-to-minimal effects on physiological measures. While it is yet unclear whether psychedelic microdosing is of therapeutic value for depression, the aforementioned effects on selective processes suggest that low doses of psychedelics could play a role in depression by inducing some kind of cognitive flexibility, which might lead to decreased rumination. While previous studies were conducted mostly in small samples of healthy volunteers, future placebo-controlled clinical trials in depressed patients are required to understand the therapeutic value of microdosing psychedelics, how this differs from therapy using full psychedelic doses, and whether different psychedelics have different effect patterns. The proposed research will give new insights into the potential of future alternative psychiatric treatment forms that are fiercely needed.",

        "The psychoactive constituent in cannabis, D(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was isolated in the mid-1960s, but the cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, and the major endogenous cannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol) were identified only 20 to 25 years later. The cannabinoid system affects both central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral processes. In this review, we have tried to summarize research--with an emphasis on recent publications--on the actions of the endocannabinoid system on anxiety, depression, neurogenesis, reward, cognition, learning, and memory. The effects are at times biphasic--lower doses causing effects opposite to those seen at high doses. Recently, numerous endocannabinoid-like compounds have been identified in the brain. Only a few have been investigated for their CNS activity, and future investigations on their action may throw light on a wide spectrum of brain functions.",

        "Microdoses of psychedelics (i.e. a sub-hallucinogenic dose taken every third day) can reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress according to anecdotal reports and observational studies. Research with medium to high doses of psilocybin points towards potential underlying mechanisms, including the modulation of emotion and interoceptive processing. In this preregistered study, we investigated whether psilocybin microdoses alter self-reported interoceptive awareness and whether repeated microdosing over 3 weeks modulates emotion processing and reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design. Participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Questionnaire 1 1/2  h after self-administering their second dose (or placebo), and the emotional go/no-go task and the shortened Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 1 1/2  h after self-administering their seventh dose. Our confirmatory analyses revealed that psilocybin microdosing did not affect emotion processing or symptoms of anxiety and depression compared with placebo. Our exploratory analyses revealed that psilocybin microdosing did not affect self-reported interoceptive awareness, that symptoms of depression and stress were significantly reduced in the first block compared with baseline, that participants broke blind in the second block and that there was no effect of expectations. Further research in a substance-naive population with clinical range anxiety and depressive symptoms is needed to substantiate the potential beneficial effects of microdosing. ",

        "The four-plates test (FPT) is an animal model of anxiety which allows the detection of anxiolytic effect not only of benzodiazepines (BZDs) but also of other non-BZDs anxiolytic compounds such as antidepressants (ADs). Furthermore, DOI, a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, has been shown to exert an anxiolytic-like effect in this model. Retesting mice in animal models of anxiety (test-retest paradigm) induces an anxiogenic-like and a loss of anxiolytic-like effects in response to BZDs and ADs. On the contrary, DOI has been reported to oppose the fear potentiation induced by trial 1 in the FPT. Despite DOI is considered as one of the most selective 5-HT(2A) available, it acts as agonist at all three 5-HT(2) receptor subtypes (5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C)). The aim of this study was thus to investigate in the FPT test-retest paradigm, which 5-HT(2) receptor subtype(s) was involved in the DOI-induced effect in experienced mice. The effect of DOI (0.25-4 mg/kg) and the agonists, 5-HT(2B), BW 723C86 (1-16 mg/kg) and 5-HT(2C), RO 60-0175 (0.25-4 mg/kg) have also been studied. Then, antagonism studies were conducted combinating the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist SR 46349B, the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist SB 206553 or the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist RS 10-2221 (at the doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) with the DOI (1 mg/kg). Our study shows that the BW 723C86 had no effect on retesting mice, whereas it exerted an anxiolytic-like effect in naive mice. By contrast to DOI, the RO 60-0175 had no effect neither in naive nor experienced mice. Furthermore, only the SR 46349B antagonized the DOI-induced anti-punishment effect. Diazepam included as a positive control also increased in each case the number of punished passages in naive mice. Our findings altogether also suggest that DOI exerts its anxiolytic-like effect in the FPT test-retest paradigm through 5-HT(2A) receptors.",

        "Over the last 10 years or so in Europe, there has been a development of the \"ecstasy\" phenomenon, which is the symbol of \"recreational\" drugs in general. Users, either alone or in private parties, are on the increase. The phenomenon is most frequent in England and in the Netherlands, with an estimated incidence of 13-18% amongst the 18-25 years old, which may reach 52% in \"exposed populations\", such as individuals who go to \"techno\" night clubs. In France, the prevalence is uncertain, but estimated at least 5% of males between 18 and 23 years old. Several substance, with more or less the same effects, are grouped together by the term \"ecstasy\", the best-known one being 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), but there are also an N-demethylated derivative (MDA), methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), N-methyl-benzodioxazolylbutanamine (MBDB) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylethylamine (2-CB or Nexus). The psychopathological consequences of MDMA in man are relatively poorly understood. On the basis of series of cases reported in the literature, acute psychosis, chronic psychosis similar to paranoid delusions, flash-back phenomena similar to with LSD, anxiety/panic states and depressive mood disorders may occur. The case which we report is therefore that of an acute psychotic episode, with residual symptomatology 6 months later, which occurred suddenly following absorption of toxic substances (alcohol and ecstasy), at least 12 hours after taking the ecstasy tablet without his knowing it, in an individual without any previous psychopathology, other than moderate social phobia. Twelve cases of acute psychotic episodes after ecstasy have been reported in the literature. Two of them occurred after a single dose and one after 2 doses. No author was able to examined the previous history of the individuals accurately, nor any possible psychopathological history. Our patient did not have any previous history of psychosis, using a standardized validated interview, which his peers and family confirmed. He did however fulfil the criteria of \"social phobia\". Retrospectively, we noted the extent of his psychomotor disinhibition with ecstasy, which seemed to be proportional to the intensity of his previous social inhibition. This point does not explain the psychotic episode. From a neurobiologic point of view, acute psychotic disorders are often related to dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. During the first 3 hours, the effect of absorption of MDMA is a massive release of the serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline stocks. Later, an acute hyposerotoninergic state is present. In our observation, the psychotic disorder appeared at least 12 hours after taking ecstasy, during the reduction phase of the intoxication. Toxicological analysis of the blood was negative (this detection is only positive for 24 hours). Like other authors, our hypothesis is that serotoninergic dysregulation affects the dopaminergic system. Sudden disappearance of serotoninergic feedback on the dopaminergic pathways, may contribute to an increase in the mesolimbic hyperdopaminergic state. In animals, it has been shown that serotonin depletion induced by MDMA, unmasks the effects of a hyperdopaminergic state. In addition, although it has not been mentioned much in the literature, MDMA disturbs dopaminergic function either directly, or through the peptidergic systems (neurotensin, substance P, dynorphines). A consistent series of arguments therefore suggest that there is a sudden central hyperdopaminergic state, which may be related to the appearance, sometimes de novo, of an acute psychotic disorder. From the published cases, psychotic disorders following absorption of ecstasy, appear to become chronic. Most of the cases occurred in individuals, who either abused multiple substances or were chronic ecstasy users. In a case like the one we report, in an individual with good general health, who is not a drug user and who has an acute episode following a single dose, the prognosis should be good. Similarly, a team from Milan has described the experience of 3 friends who had a brief psychotic episode, following ingestion of substances containing ecstasy. These episodes resolved completely, after rehydration and anxiolytic treatment. However, after 6 months' follow-up, our patient still has psychotic symptoms, albeit mild, but which were not present before the intoxication. The patient and his psychiatrist do not envisage changing or stopping his antipsychotic treatment. Other authors have described a lesion in the serotoninergic neurons, by making a parallel with toxic effects described in animals, in particular in primates, with MDMA. Degradation of the serotoninergic cell bodies and nerve endings has been suggested to occur with high doses and/or repeated doses of MDMA. Other authors show the large variations in MDMA and MDA metabolism. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",

        "Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is an indole-based secondary metabolite produced by numerous species of mushrooms. South American Aztec Indians referred to them as teonanacatl, meaning \"god's flesh,\" and they were used in religious and healing rituals. Spanish missionaries in the 1500s attempted to destroy all records and evidence of the use of these mushrooms. Nevertheless, a 16th century Spanish Franciscan friar and historian mentioned teonanacatl in his extensive writings, intriguing 20th century ethnopharmacologists and leading to a decades-long search for the identity of teonanacatl. Their search ultimately led to a 1957 photo-essay in a popular magazine, describing for the Western world the use of these mushrooms. Specimens were ultimately obtained, and their active principle identified and chemically synthesized. In the past 10-15 years several FDA-approved clinical studies have indicated potential medical value for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in treating depression, anxiety, and certain addictions. At present, assuming that the early clinical studies can be validated by larger studies, psilocybin is poised to make a significant impact on treatments available to psychiatric medicine.",

        "The classic serotonergic hallucinogens, or psychedelics, have the ability to profoundly alter perception and behavior. These can include visual distortions, hallucinations, detachment from reality, and mystical experiences. Some psychedelics, like LSD, are able to produce these effects with remarkably low doses of drug. Others, like psilocybin, have recently been demonstrated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction that persist for at least several months after only a single therapeutic session. How does this occur? Much work has recently been published from imaging studies showing that psychedelics alter brain network connectivity. They facilitate a disintegration of the default mode network, producing a hyperconnectivity between brain regions that allow centers that do not normally communicate with each other to do so. The immediate and acute effects on both behaviors and network connectivity are likely mediated by effector pathways downstream of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation. These acute molecular processes also influence gene expression changes, which likely influence synaptic plasticity and facilitate more long-term changes in brain neurochemistry ultimately underlying the therapeutic efficacy of a single administration to achieve long-lasting effects. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the molecular genetic responses to psychedelics within the brain and discuss how gene expression changes may contribute to altered cellular physiology and behaviors.",

        "To investigate the harmful health effects of taking ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) for recreational purposes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched. Additional information on deaths was collected from the General Mortality Register (GMR) and the Special Mortality Register collated by the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD). Studies were categorised according to design, with systematic research syntheses (Level I evidence) the most valid and least open to bias. Where Level I evidence was not available, controlled observational studies (Level II evidence) were systematically reviewed. If neither Level I nor Level II evidence was available, uncontrolled case series and case reports (Level III evidence) were systematically surveyed. Data were extracted by one reviewer and a sample checked by a second. The heterogeneity of Level II evidence was addressed by undertaking stratified analyses for current and former ecstasy users and comparing them either with control groups using other illegal drugs but not ecstasy (polydrug controls) or with controls naive to illegal drugs (drug-naive controls). Statistical heterogeneity was minimised by using a random-effects model throughout and investigated using study-level regression analysis (metaregression). Five Level I syntheses were identified; for each it was difficult to ascertain the exact methods adopted and evidence included. Small but significant deficits for ecstasy users compared to controls were reported in areas relating to attention, memory, psychomotor speed, executive systems functioning, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Data from Level II studies were directly pooled for seven individual outcomes, suggesting that ecstasy users performed worse than controls on common measures of immediate and delayed verbal recall (RAVLT, RBMT, digit span). No difference was seen in IQ (NART). The 915 outcome measures identified in Level II studies were analysed in broad domains: immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, working memory, two measures of attention, three measures of executive function, perceptual organisation, self-rated depression, memory and anxiety, and impulsivity measured objectively and subjectively. Ecstasy users performed significantly worse than polydrug controls in 13/16 domains and significantly worse than drug-naive controls in 7/12 domains for which sufficient data were available. The largest, most consistent exposure effects were seen in meta-analyses of memory (especially verbal and working memory, with less marked effects seen in visual memory). Former ecstasy users frequently showed deficits that matched or exceeded those seen amongst current users. At aggregate level, the effects do not appear to be dose-related, but are variably confounded by other drug use, particularly alcohol. Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year. Retrospective case series, based on hospital emergency department records, reported a death rate of 0-2% from emergency admissions related to ecstasy. Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms. The clinical significance of the exposure effect in individual cases will be variable but, on average, deficits are likely to be relatively small. Ecstasy is associated with a range of acute harms but appears to be a rare cause of death in isolation. ",

        "Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent mental health condition with substantial impact on daily functioning that lacks sufficient treatment options. Here we evaluate six phase 2 trials in a pooled analysis to determine the study design for phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. Six randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials at five study sites were conducted from April 2004 to February 2017. Active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg, n = 72) or placebo/control doses (0-40 mg, n = 31) were administered to individuals with PTSD during manualized psychotherapy sessions in two or three 8-h sessions spaced a month apart. Three non-drug 90-min therapy sessions preceded the first MDMA exposure, and three to four followed each experimental session. After two blinded experimental sessions, the active group had significantly greater reductions in CAPS-IV total scores from baseline than the control group [MMRM estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 22.0 (5.17), P < 0.001]. The between-group Cohen's d effect size was 0.8, indicating a large treatment effect. After two experimental sessions, more participants in the active group (54.2%) did not meet CAPS-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria than the control group (22.6%). Depression symptom improvement on the BDI-II was greatest for the active group compared to the control group, although only trended towards significant group differences [MMRM, estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 6.0 (3.03), P = 0.053]. All doses of MDMA were well tolerated, with some expected reactions occurring at greater frequency for the active MDMA group during experimental sessions and the 7 days following. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was efficacious and well tolerated in a large sample of adults with PTSD. These studies supported expansion into phase 3 trials and led to FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy designation for this promising treatment.

        "The current meta-analysis examined the effects of psilocybin in combination with behavioral interventions on anxiety and depression in samples with elevated symptoms. Across four studies (one uncontrolled; three randomized, placebo-controlled; N = 117), within-group pre-post and pre-follow-up effects on anxiety and depression were large (Hedges' gs=1.16 to 1.47) and statistically significant. Across three placebo-controlled studies, pre-post placebo-controlled effects were also large (gs = 0.82 to 0.83) and statistically significant. No serious adverse events were reported. Limitations include the small number of studies and risk for bias within studies. Results tentatively support future research on psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety and depression.",

        "Ketamine and its enantiomer esketamine represent promising new treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Esketamine induces acute, transient psychoactive effects. How patients perceive esketamine treatment, and which conditions facilitate optimal outcomes, remains poorly understood. Understanding patient perspectives on these phenomena is important to identify unmet needs, which can be used to improve (es)ketamine treatments. To explore the perspectives of TRD patients participating in \"off label\" oral esketamine treatment. In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 patients (11 women) after a six-week, twice-weekly esketamine treatment program, and subsequently after six months of at-home use. Interviews explored participants' perspectives, expectations, and experiences with esketamine treatment. Audio interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed following an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) framework. Key themes included overwhelming experiences; inadequate preparation; letting go of control; mood states influencing session experiences; presence and emotional support, and supportive settings. Patients' attempts to let go and give into vs. attempts to maintain control over occasionally overwhelming experiences was a central theme. Multiple factors influenced patients' ability to give into the experience and appeared to impact their mood and anxiety about future sessions, including level of preparation and education, physical and emotional support, and setting during the session. Better preparation beforehand, an optimized treatment setting, and emotional and psychological support during (es)ketamine sessions can help patients to \"let go\" and may lead to better quality of care and outcomes. Recommendations to improve quality of patient care in (es)ketamine treatment are provided, including suggestions for the training of nurses and other support staff. ",

        "Neuropathic pain (NeP) is prevalent in patients with peripheral neuropathy (PN), regardless of etiology. We sought to compare the efficacy of the cannabinoid nabilone as either monotherapy or adjuvant therapy with a first-line medication for NeP, gabapentin, in a patient population with PN-NeP. Patients diagnosed with PN-NeP were permitted to initiate monotherapy (nabilone or gabapentin) or add one of these two medications (adjuvant therapy) to their existing NeP treatment regimen in a non-randomized open-label nature. Baseline data collected included a primary outcome (visual analog scores [VAS] of pain) and secondary outcomes (quality of life [EuroQol 5 Domains and Short-Form 36] assessments and assessments of sleep [Medical Outcomes Sleep Study Scale {MOSSS}], anxiety and depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale], and pain [Brief Pain Inventory]). Reassessment and modulation of dosing and/or medications occurred at 3- and 6-month intervals. Medication adverse effects and drug efficacy, as well as questionnaires, were assessed at 6 months. Matched analysis of variance testing was performed to compare 3- and 6-month scores with baseline, as well as to compare therapies at equal time points. Significant improvements in pain VAS were seen in all treatment groups at 6 months. Numerous sleep parameters within MOSSS, Brief Pain Inventory, and Short-Form 36 improved in patients receiving nabilone or gabapentin either as monotherapy or adjuvant treatment. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A scores were significantly improved in all treatment groups. Sleep adequacy and the sleep problems index within the MOSSS improved in nabilone monotherapy patients in particular. The benefits of monotherapy or adjuvant therapy with nabilone appear comparable to gabapentin for management of NeP. We advocate for head-to-head randomized, double-blind studies for current therapies for NeP in order to determine potential advantages beneficial in this patient population.",

        "Little is known about cannabis use for insomnia in individuals with depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety. To develop a better understanding of distinct profiles of cannabis use for insomnia management, a retrospective cohort study was conducted on a large naturalistic sample. Data were collected using the medicinal cannabis tracking app, Strainprint(r), which allows users to monitor and track cannabis use for therapeutic purposes. The current study examined users managing insomnia symptoms in depression (n = 100), anxiety (n = 463), and comorbid depression and anxiety (n = 114), for a total of 8476 recorded sessions. Inferential analyses used linear mixed effects modeling to examine self-perceived improvement across demographic variables and cannabis product variables. Overall, cannabis was perceived to be efficacious across all groups, regardless of age and gender. Dried flower and oral oil were reported as the most used and most efficacious product forms. In the depression group, all strains were perceived to be efficacious and comparisons between strains revealed indica-dominant (M = 1.81, 95% CI 1.26-2.36, P < .001), indica hybrid (M = 1.34, 95% CI 0.46-2.22, P = .045), and sativa-dominant (M = 1.83, 95% CI 0.68-2.99, P = .028) strains were significantly more efficacious than CBD-dominant strains. In anxiety and comorbid conditions, all strain categories were perceived to be efficacious with no significant differences between strains. In terms of perceptions, individuals with depression, anxiety, and both conditions who use cannabis for insomnia report significant improvements in symptom severity after cannabis use. The current study highlights the need for placebo-controlled trials investigating symptom improvement and the safety of cannabinoids for sleep in individuals with mood and anxiety disorders. ",

        "The classical serotonergic psychedelics LSD, psilocybin, mescaline are not known to cause brain damage and are regarded as non-addictive. Clinical studies do not suggest that psychedelics cause long-term mental health problems. Psychedelics have been used in the Americas for thousands of years. Over 30 million people currently living in the US have used LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline. To evaluate the association between the lifetime use of psychedelics and current mental health in the adult population. Data drawn from years 2001 to 2004 of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health consisted of 130,152 respondents, randomly selected to be representative of the adult population in the United States. Standardized screening measures for past year mental health included serious psychological distress (K6 scale), mental health treatment (inpatient, outpatient, medication, needed but did not receive), symptoms of eight psychiatric disorders (panic disorder, major depressive episode, mania, social phobia, general anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-affective psychosis), and seven specific symptoms of non-affective psychosis. We calculated weighted odds ratios by multivariate logistic regression controlling for a range of sociodemographic variables, use of illicit drugs, risk taking behavior, and exposure to traumatic events. 21,967 respondents (13.4% weighted) reported lifetime psychedelic use. There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, lifetime use of specific psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote), or past year use of LSD and increased rate of any of the mental health outcomes. Rather, in several cases psychedelic use was associated with lower rate of mental health problems. We did not find use of psychedelics to be an independent risk factor for mental health problems. ",

        "Subjective experiences seem to play an important role in the enduring effects of psychedelic experiences. Although the importance of the subjective experience on the impact of psychedelics is frequently discussed, a more detailed understanding of the subtypes of psychedelic experiences and their associated impacts on mental health has not been well documented. In the current study, machine learning cluster analysis was used to derive three subtypes of psychedelic experience in a large (n = 985) cross sectional sample. These subtypes are not only associated with reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms and other markers of psychological wellbeing, but the structure of these subtypes and their subsequent impact on mental health are highly reproducible across multiple psychedelic substances. Data were obtained via retrospective self-report, which does not allow for definitive conclusions about the direction of causation between baseline characteristics of respondents, qualities of subjective experience, and outcomes. The present analysis suggests that psychedelic experiences, in particular those that are associated with enduring improvements in mental health, may be characterized by reproducible and predictable subtypes of the subjective psychedelic effects. These subtypes appear to be significantly different with respect to the baseline demographic characteristics, baseline measures of mental health, and drug type and dose. These findings also suggest that efforts to increase psychedelic associated personal and mystical insight experiences may be key to maximizing beneficial impact of clinical approaches using this treatment in their patients.

        "To investigate the impact of inpatient detoxification treatment on psychiatric symptoms of chronic cannabis addicts and to analyze the influence of serum cannabinoid levels on the severity of these symptoms. Thirty five treatment-seeking, not active co-morbid chronic cannabis dependents (ICD-10) were studied on admission and on abstinence days 8 and 16, using several observational and self-report scales, such as Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Simultaneously obtained serum was analyzed with regard to levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its main metabolites 11-hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-OH) and 11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH). At admission, nearly 90% of the patients were not, or only mildly, affected by depression, anxiety or manic symptoms. In contrast, patients' self-description indicated a strong psychiatric burden in approximately 60% of the cases. All patients improved significantly within 16 days of the treatment. Effect sizes ranged from 0.7 to 1.4. (Cohen's d) for the respective scales. Serum THC-levels were positively associated with impairment of cognition in HAMA and motor retardation in BPRS. All other test results were not significantly related to the serum levels of the measured cannabinoids. Effects of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome and executive dysfunctions might explain the discrepancy between the observer ratings and self-reported psychiatric burden. Inpatient cannabis detoxification treatment significantly improved psychiatric symptoms. Serum THC-levels were not associated with affective symptoms and anxiety but predicted cognitive impairment and motor retardation. ",

        "Use of the drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') can have long-term adverse effects on emotion in both humans and laboratory animals. The present study examined whether chronic treatment with the antidepressant drug fluoxetine could reverse such effects. Male Wistar rats were briefly exposed to MDMA (4 x 5 mg/kg over 4 h) or vehicle on 2 consecutive days. Approximately 9-12 weeks later, half of the rats received a dose of approximately 6 mg/kg/day fluoxetine in their drinking water for a 5-week period. Fluoxetine administration reduced fluid intake and body weight in MDMA and vehicle pretreated rats. After several weeks of fluoxetine treatment, rats were assessed on the social interaction test, the emergence test of anxiety and the forced swim model of depression. MDMA pretreated rats showed reduced social interaction, increased anxiety on the emergence test, and increased immobility and decreased active responses in the forced swim test. Fluoxetine treatment reversed MDMA-induced anxiety in the emergence test and depressive-like effects in the forced swim test, yet exhibited no effects on the social interaction test. MDMA pretreated rats had decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in limbic and cortical regions, and decreased density of serotonin transporter sites in the cortex. Fluoxetine treatment did not greatly affect 5-HT levels in MDMA pretreated rats, but significantly decreased 5-HIAA levels in all brain sites examined. Postmortem blood serum levels of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine did not differ in MDMA and vehicle pretreated rats. These results indicate that fluoxetine may provide a treatment option for some of the deleterious long-term effects resulting from MDMA exposure.",

        "Previous findings report use of the drug ecstasy (MDMA) to be associated with lower emotional intelligence (EI), and compromised functioning in brain areas responsible for emotion. This study explored the relationship between ecstasy use, EI, mood and parenting styles. Questionnaire measures of drug use, lifestyle, parenting style and EI were obtained, with separate IQ measures for fluid intelligence (Ravens matrices) and pre-morbid intelligence [National Adult Reading Test (NART)]. Current mood measures were obtained from an adjective checklist. The sample comprised 78 ecstasy/polydrug users, 38 cannabis only users and 34 non-drug users. Drug use was categorised at three levels (non-user, cannabis-only user and ecstasy-polydrug user). Factorial ANOVA using drug use as an independent variable showed no significant group effects in EI. EI showed significant correlations with current mood that were positive for arousal and negative for both anxiety and depression. EI was also significantly and positively correlated with the perceived degree of parental control. Regression analyses showed that these relationships remained significant after controlling for differences in IQ, age, gender, and ecstasy use. Adverse mood effects specifically associated with ecstasy use were significantly related to lower EI, and were independent of IQ, age and gender. Higher EI was significantly associated with ecstasy-related precautions used when taking this drug. Contrary to earlier findings, ecstasy-polydrug users did not differ from non-users on EI. However, self-reported ecstasy-related mood disturbances were related to lower EI, with the compromising of orbitofrontal cortical functioning being possible here.",

        "Paranoia is receiving increasing attention in its own right, since it is a central experience of psychotic disorders and a marker of the health of a society. Paranoia is associated with use of the most commonly taken illicit drug, cannabis. The objective was to determine whether the principal psychoactive ingredient of cannabis-(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-causes paranoia and to use the drug as a probe to identify key cognitive mechanisms underlying paranoia. A randomized, placebo-controlled, between-groups test of the effects of intravenous THC was conducted. A total of 121 individuals with paranoid ideation were randomized to receive placebo, THC, or THC preceded by a cognitive awareness condition. Paranoia was assessed extensively via a real social situation, an immersive virtual reality experiment, and standard self-report and interviewer measures. Putative causal factors were assessed. Principal components analysis was used to create a composite paranoia score and composite causal variables to be tested in a mediation analysis. THC significantly increased paranoia, negative affect (anxiety, worry, depression, negative thoughts about the self), and a range of anomalous experiences, and reduced working memory capacity. The increase in negative affect and in anomalous experiences fully accounted for the increase in paranoia. Working memory changes did not lead to paranoia. Making participants aware of the effects of THC had little impact. In this largest study of intravenous THC, it was definitively demonstrated that the drug triggers paranoid thoughts in vulnerable individuals. The most likely mechanism of action causing paranoia was the generation of negative affect and anomalous experiences.",

        "Psychedelics are powerful psychoactive substances. Natural psychedelics have been used for millennia by human civilizations, in particular in Latin America, while synthetic psychedelics were discovered in the 50s, giving rise to a lot of research before they were prohibited. More recently, their therapeutic properties have been studied especially to help patients with psychiatric conditions, psychological distress or substance use disorders. This article is a systematic review of the literature which aims to provide an overview of all studies that assessed the efficacy of psychedelics, i.e. psilocybin, ayahuasca and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), on psychiatric diseases and addictions. We conducted this literature review following the PRISMA recommendations. MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Scopus were searched from January 1990 to May 2020 with the following keywords \"(ayahuasca OR psilocybin OR lysergic acid diethylamide) AND (depression OR anxiety OR major depressive disorder OR bipolar disorder OR anxiety disorder OR substance use disorder OR dependence)\". Twenty-five articles met the inclusion criteria. Five articles studied psychedelic efficacy in the treatment of life-threatening diseases related to anxiety and depression: four were randomized controlled crossover trials (three with psilocybin for a total of 92 patients, and one with LSD, n=12), and one was a long-term follow-up study. Eleven articles explored the efficacy of psychedelics in the treatment of major depressive episodes: two were open-labeled trials (one with ayahuasca, n=17, one with psilocybin, n=20), one was a randomized controlled trial using ayahuasca against placebo (n=29), and the others were long-term follow-up studies or assessed more precise dimensions of the depressive disorder, such as suicidality, emotion processing or personality traits. Eight articles studied the efficacy of psychedelics in the treatment of addictions: two were open-labeled studies using psilocybin (one in alcohol use disorder, n=10, and one in tobacco use disorder, n=15), and the others were long-term follow-up studies or retrospective observational descriptive studies on alcohol, tobacco, opioids, cannabis, and psychostimulants. One study explored the efficacy of psilocybin in obsessional-compulsive disorder (n=9). Overall, these studies found a quick and important response after psychedelic administration that lasted for several months, even after a single dose. However most of these studies were descriptive or open-label studies conducted on small size samples. No severe adverse events occurred. Psychedelics are promising treatments for anxiety, depression and addiction, their efficacy is quick and sustainable, and they are well tolerated. These effects need to be confirmed in larger studies and compared to standard care. ",

        "Research shows that cannabis use frequency is associated with cannabis dependence and health metrics. However, much less is known about how self-reported cannabis potency (THC and CBD) may be associated with the same metrics, and whether any associations exist after accounting for frequency of cannabis use. Moreover, even less is known about how these relations may differ across cannabis product forms. This exploratory study examined 1) associations between cannabis frequency, potency, and cannabis/health metrics, and 2) whether associations between potency and cannabis/health metrics remained after controlling for frequency of use. Using a sample of adult recreational cannabis users in Colorado (N = 300), we tested the relationship between self-reported cannabis use metrics of frequency and potency of flower, edible, and concentrate products with separate measures of problematic cannabis use (i.e., dependence, withdrawal, craving), depression, anxiety, and general perceived health. Greater frequency of flower and concentrate (but not edible) use were associated with greater problematic cannabis use, and greater concentrate use frequency was also associated with more mental health problems. Partial correlations controlling for average frequency of use across all product forms and CBD potency per product showed that one significant association between THC potency and cannabis/health metrics remained (i.e., higher THC concentrate potency with better health), and one emerged (i.e., higher THC concentrate potency with lower cannabis withdrawal). Frequency of use is reliably associated with problematic cannabis use for flower and concentrates, but it did not account for all observed associations in this study. Differences in patterns of associations between frequency and potency and cannabis/health metrics across cannabis forms suggest a need for better understanding user reports of THC and CBD potency, individual differences among users, and improved measurement.

        "To conduct a systematic literature review of animal and human studies reporting anxiolytic or antidepressive effects of ayahuasca or some of its isolated alkaloids (dimethyltryptamine, harmine, tetrahydroharmine, and harmaline). Papers published until 3 April 2015 were retrieved from the PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases following a comprehensive search strategy and using a predetermined set of criteria for article selection. Five hundred and fourteen studies were identified, of which 21 met the established criteria. Studies in animals have shown anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca, harmine, and harmaline, and experimental studies in humans and mental health assessments of experienced ayahuasca consumers also suggest that ayahuasca is associated with reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. A pilot study reported rapid antidepressive effects of a single ayahuasca dose in six patients with recurrent depression. Considering the need for new drugs that produce fewer adverse effects and are more effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptomatology, the described effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids should be further investigated.

        "After decades of sociopolitical obstacles, the field of psychiatry is experiencing a revived interest in the use of hallucinogenic agents to treat brain disorders. Along with the use of ketamine for depression, recent pilot studies have highlighted the efficacy of classic serotonergic hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin, in treating addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. However, many basic pharmacological and toxicological questions remain unanswered with regard to these compounds. In this study, we discuss psychedelic medicine as well as the behavioral and toxicological effects of hallucinogenic drugs in zebrafish. We emphasize this aquatic organism as a model ideally suited to assess both the potential toxic and therapeutic effects of major known classes of hallucinogenic compounds. In addition, novel drugs with hallucinogenic properties can be efficiently screened using zebrafish models. Well-designed preclinical studies utilizing zebrafish can contribute to the reemerging treatment paradigm of psychedelic medicine, leading to new avenues of clinical exploration for psychiatric disorders.",

        "Healthful behaviours such as maintaining a balanced diet, being physically active and refraining from smoking have major impacts on the risk of developing cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and other serious conditions. The burden of the so-called 'lifestyle diseases'-in personal suffering, premature mortality and public health costs-is considerable. Consequently, interventions designed to promote healthy behaviours are increasingly being studied, e.g., using psychobiological models of behavioural regulation and change. In this article, we explore the notion that psychedelic substances such as psilocybin could be used to assist in promoting positive lifestyle change conducive to good overall health. Psilocybin has a low toxicity, is non-addictive and has been shown to predict favourable changes in patients with depression, anxiety and other conditions marked by rigid behavioural patterns, including substance (mis)use. While it is still early days for modern psychedelic science, research is advancing fast and results are promising. Here we describe psychedelics' proposed mechanisms of action and research findings pertinent to health behaviour change science, hoping to generate discussion and new research hypotheses linking the two areas. Therapeutic models including psychedelic experiences and common behaviour change methods (e.g., Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Motivational Interviewing) are already being tested for addiction and eating disorders. We believe this research may soon be extended to help promote improved diet, exercise, nature exposure and also mindfulness or stress reduction practices, all of which can contribute to physical and psychological health and well-being.",

        "Psychedelics are a hallucinogenic class of psychoactive drugs with the primary effect of activating non-ordinary states of consciousness. Due to the positive preliminary findings of these drugs in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, the number of registered clinical studies has risen significantly. In this paper, clinical studies registered on clinicaltrials.gov that evaluate the treatment of any psychiatric disorder with psychedelics (excluding ketamine) are summarized and analyzed. 70 registered studies were identified from a clinicaltrials.gov search on December 3, 2020. The majority of studies aim to investigate methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (45.7%) and psilocybin (41.4%). Studies evaluating ayahuasca, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ibogaine hydrochloride, salvia divinorum, 5-MeO-DMT and DMT fumarate were less common at 1.4%, 4.2%, 2.8%, 1.4%, 1.4% and 1.4% of total registered studies, respectively. Most of the studies on MDMA, psilocybin, ayahuasca and salvia divinorum investigated their therapeutic effect on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). LSD was investigated for MDD, anxiety, and severe somatic disorders and ibogaine hydrochloride was investigated for substance and alcohol use disorders. 5-MeO-DMT and DMT fumarate were both investigated for MDD. Only 21/70 registered studies had published results with the majority not yet completed. In view of the large number of ongoing studies investigating psychedelics, it is imperative that these studies are considered by researchers and stakeholders in deciding the most relevant research priorities for future proposed studies.",

        "Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor which also interacts with various other receptors that account for its myriad actions. Originally approved as a general anesthetic, it is being explored to be repurposed for numerous other indications such as depressive disorders, suicidal ideation, substance-use disorders, anxiety disorders, chronic pain, refractory status epilepticus, and bronchial asthma exacerbations. Numerous trials are ongoing for the same. The nasal spray of esketamine, a more potent S (+) enantiomer of ketamine, has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for treatment-resistant depression along with the oral antidepressants. However, there are concerns about its safety on long term use, given its psychedelic effects and potential abuse. In this review, we discuss repurposing ketamine for potential therapeutic use and about the safety concerns related to ketamine and esketamine.",

        "Present the evolution in the characteristics of drug addicts treated in the Addictions-Sud centre (Marseille) between 1996 and 2001, and compare the profile of patients according to the substitution therapy prescribed. Descriptive analysis of the data collected from the inclusion questionnaire of patients seen during a hospital consultation in the centre and registered in a substitution program (n = 585 patients). In our active file, the use of heroin and injections has decreased since 1996, whereas the consumption of cocaine and above all amphetamines and LSD has greatly increased. When treated, 60% of the patients were administered methadone and 40% BHD. (The patients included in the methadone program (n = 348) were considerably older and frequently HIV or hepatitis C-infected than those treated with BHD (n = 229)). The proportion of patients who had previously undertaken withdrawal or substitution measures, and who continued to inject drugs, was greater in the group of patients in the methadone program. The presence of depression, psychotic disorders and anxiety was noted respectively in 46, 30 and 24% of the patients treated. Today, it is crucial that information on the treatment of drug addicts should be reinforced, so as to measure the progression of the problems encountered, specify the indications of the two substitution products currently prescribed and understand the impact they have on the psychiatric disorders and viral pathologies frequently noted in drug addicts.

        "The syndrome of paroxysmal perceptual alteration (PPA) was first described by Yamaguchi in 1985. Since then, many PPA cases have been reported, and its pathophysiological mechanism has been proposed: a suppressed (blocked) mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic system and sequential compensatory increase of noradrenergic neuronal activity are crucial for the occurrence of PPA. PPA is characterized by hypersensitivity of perception, psychedelic experience (brightening of colors, sharpening of contrast, visual distortion, etc.), and somatic schema disorder (one feels that one is floating, one's extremities are being pulled and elongated, etc.). PPA in chronic schizophrenic patients occurs abruptly like an attack mainly in the evening, often precipitated by fatigue. During the attack, patients also suffer from mood and thought alteration (anxiety, agitation, depressive mood, and inability to distract their thoughts from one thing), but they are aware that symptoms of PPA are not real and apprehensive about them. The attack ceases gradually and spontaneously while the patient rests or sleeps. These clinical features are clearly different from those of schizophrenic hallucinations. It is believed that PPA is closely related to neuroleptic treatment by conventional antipsychotics. I reported the prevalence of PPA as 4.0% in 1991 when high potential D2 blocking agents were prevailing. The occurrence of PPA has been significantly reduced to the present, when second generation (atypical) antipsychotics are prevailing. However, in my inquiry in 2004, the prevalence of PPA was 3.6% in cases treated with risperidone (RIS), while the rates were 0 in cases treated with olanzapine (OLZ), quetiapine (QTP), and perospirone (PRS). Several cases of PPA have been reported in patients who were treated with OLZ and PRS. Until now, no cases of PPA have been reported who were treated with QTP and aripiprazole (APZ). The prevalence of PPA among cases treated with these second generation antipsychotics might be related to the differences in these agents regarding their affinity for the D2 receptor: RIS has a sustained and close binding affinity, which might be similar to those of conventional antipsychotics, OLZ shows a sustained and loose binding affinity, PRS exhibits a transient and close binding affinity, whereas QTP has a transient and loose binding affinity. APZ is a partial agonist of the D2 receptor; APZ acts as an agonist under the condition of intrinsic dopaminergic dysfunction, which might prevent the occurrence of PPA.",

        "We reanalyzed a multisite 26-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of 600 mg twice-a-day Gabapentin Enacarbil Extended-Release (GE-XR), a gabapentin prodrug, designed to evaluate safety and efficacy for treating alcohol use disorder. In the original analysis (n = 338), published in 2019, GE-XR did not differ from placebo. Our aim is to advance precision medicine by identifying likely responders to GE-XR from the trial data and to determine for likely responders if GE-XR is causally superior to placebo. The primary outcome measure in the reanalysis is the reduction from baseline of the number of heavy drinking days (DHDD). Baseline features including measures of alcohol use, anxiety, depression, mood states, sleep, and impulsivity were used in a random forest (RF) model to predict DHDD to treatment with GE-XR based on those assigned to GE-XR. The resulting RF model was used to obtain predicted outcomes for those randomized to GE-XR and counterfactually to those randomized to placebo. Likely responders to GE-XR were defined as those predicted to have a reduction of 14 days or more. Tests of causal superiority of GE-XR to placebo were obtained for likely responders and for the whole sample. For likely responders, GE-XR was causally superior to placebo (p < 0.0033), while for the whole sample, there was no difference. Likely responders exhibited improved outcomes for the related outcomes of percent HDD and drinks per week. Compared with unlikely responders, at baseline likely responders had higher HDDs; lower levels of anxiety, depression, and general mood disturbances; and higher levels of cognitive and motor impulsivity. There are substantial causal benefits of treatment with GE-XR for a subset of patients predicted to be likely responders. The likely responder statistical paradigm is a promising approach for analyzing randomized clinical trials to advance personalized treatment. ",

Patterns of symptomatology across the disease continuum are also discussed. Interventions targeted at treating these symptoms are reviewed, including acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, mind-body therapies, and meaning-based approaches designed for people with advanced stages of disease, including psychedelic therapy. Common methodological issues and shortcomings of the evidence base are summarized with design recommendations, and a discussion of trends in future research including pragmatic research design, digital health interventions, and implementation science completes the article.",

        "Psilocybin has been shown to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety when combined with psychotherapy or other clinician-guided interventions. To understand the neural basis for this pattern of clinical efficacy, experimental and conceptual approaches that are different than traditional laboratory models of anxiety and depression are needed. A potential novel mechanism is that acute psilocybin improves cognitive flexibility, which then enhances the impact of clinician-assisted interventions. Consistent with this idea, we find that acute psilocybin robustly improves cognitive flexibility in male and female rats using a task where animals switched between previously learned strategies in response to uncued changes in the environment. Psilocybin did not influence Pavlovian reversal learning, suggesting that its cognitive effects are selective to enhanced switching between previously learned behavioral strategies. The serotonin (5HT) 2A receptor antagonist ketanserin blocked psilocybin's effect on set-shifting, while a 5HT2C-selective antagonist did not. Ketanserin alone also improved set-shifting performance, suggesting a complex relationship between psilocybin's pharmacology and its impact on flexibility. Further, the psychedelic drug 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) impaired cognitive flexibility in the same task, suggesting that this effect of psilocybin does not generalize to all other serotonergic psychedelics. We conclude that the acute impact of psilocybin on cognitive flexibility provides a useful behavioral model to investigate its neuronal effects relevant to its positive clinical outcome.",

        "Ecstasy use may result in lowered mood, anxiety or aggression in the days following use. Yet, few studies have investigated what factors increase the risk of experiencing such symptoms. Ecstasy users (at least once in the last 12 months) who subsequently took ecstasy (n=35) over the period of one week, were compared on measures of mood, sleep, stress and drug use, with those who abstained from ecstasy (n=21) that week. Measures were administered the week prior to ecstasy use and one and three days following use, or the equivalent day for abstainers. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Kessler-10 self-report psychological distress scale, a subjective mood rating (1-10), and using the depression, anxiety and hostility items from the clinician-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Timeline Followback methods were used to collect information on drug use and life stress in the past month. Self-reported sleep quality was also assessed. Ecstasy use was not associated with subacute depressive, anxiety or aggressive symptoms. Rather, lowered mood and increased psychological distress were associated with self-reported hours and quality of sleep obtained during the three-day follow-up. These findings highlight the importance of considering sleep disruption in understanding the short-term mood effects of ecstasy use.",

        "Anecdotal reports suggest that the administration of sub-hallucinogenic doses of psychedelic compounds on a chronic, intermittent schedule - a practice known as psychedelic microdosing - is becoming increasingly popular among young adults due to its purported ability to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety while improving cognitive function and promoting social interaction. Using an anonymous online survey, we collected data from 2347 people to 1) assess the prevalence of psychedelic microdosing and characterize the demographics of microdosers, 2) determine whether microdosers associate the practice with changes in mood, cognitive function, social interaction, or physiology, and 3) investigate frequent motives for discontinuing the practice. Fifty-nine percent of respondents (N= 2183) reported familiarity with the concept of psychedelic microdosing, with 17% (383 respondents, N = 2200) having engaged in this practice. Microdosers attributed psychedelic microdosing with improving their mood, decreasing their anxiety, and enhancing their memory, attention, and sociability. The most frequently cited reasons for quitting microdosing (N= 243) were the risks associated with taking an illegal substance (24.28%) and the difficulty of obtaining psychedelic compounds (22.63%). Overall, our findings suggest that psychedelic microdosing is relatively common and is subjectively associated with a broad spectrum of socio-affective, cognitive, and physical outcomes. ",

        "The success of modern medicine creates a growing population of those suffering from life-threatening illnesses (LTI) who often experience anxiety, depression, and existential distress. We present a novel approach; investigating MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of anxiety in people with an LTI. Participants with anxiety from an LTI were randomized in a double-blind study to receive MDMA (125 mg, n = 13) or placebo (n = 5) in combination with two 8-h psychotherapy sessions. The primary outcome was change in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Trait scores from baseline to one month post the second experimental session. After unblinding, participants in the MDMA group had one open-label MDMA session and placebo participants crossed over to receive three open-label MDMA sessions. Additional follow-up assessments occurred six and twelve months after a participant's last experimental session. At the primary endpoint, the MDMA group had a greater mean (SD) reduction in STAI-Trait scores, - 23.5 (13.2), indicating less anxiety, compared to placebo group, - 8.8 (14.7); results did not reach a significant group difference (p = .056). Hedges' g between-group effect size was 1.03 (95% CI: - 5.25, 7.31). Overall, MDMA was well-tolerated in this sample. These preliminary findings can inform development of larger clinical trials to further examine MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a novel approach to treat individuals with LTI-related anxiety.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02427568, first registered April 28, 2015.",

        "The therapeutic potential of the psychedelic brew ayahuasca has been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. Currently, the most consistent evidence refers to depression. However, various studies suggest that ayahuasca may comprise therapeutic benefits in other health conditions. This narrative review provides a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of ayahuasca's therapeutic effects in diverse clinical conditions in human (clinical, cross-sectional, observational, and qualitative) and preclinical (animal and in vitro) studies. In addition to summarizing and discussing the most commonly studied conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders (SUD), we also examine less frequently studied psychiatric, neurological, and physical conditions. Moreover, we discuss evidence from epidemiological studies on the impact of regular, long-term ayahuasca use on health and psychosocial outcomes. Overall, evidence for depression and SUD is more consistent, with numerous and diverse studies. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that other conditions equally relevant to public health might be promising targets for ayahuasca's therapeutic effects. This includes preliminary studies indicating potential for grief, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and severe physical illnesses (e.g., cancer, chronic conditions). Moreover, preliminary evidence in long-term ayahuasca users does not suggest detrimental effects but possible benefits for individual and collective health. In light of the emerging evidence of psychedelic drugs as therapeutic agents, it is essential to further investigate in rigorous designs the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in conditions other than depression.",

        "Inhibition of monoamine oxidase is one way to treat depression and anxiety. The information now available on the pharmacokinetics of flavonoids and of the components of tobacco prompted an exploration of whether a healthy diet (with or without smoking) provides active compounds in amounts sufficient to partially inhibit monoamine oxidase. A literature search was used to identify dietary monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the levels of these compounds in foods, the pharmacokinetics of the absorption and distribution, and tissue levels observed. An estimated daily intake and the expected tissue concentrations were compared with the measured efficacies of the compounds as inhibitors of monoamine oxidases. Norharman, harman and quercetin dietary presence, pharmacokinetics, and tissue levels were consistent with significant levels reaching neuronal monoamine oxidase from the diet or smoking; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, eugenol, 1-piperoylpiperidine, and coumarin were not. Quercetin was equipotent with norharman as a monoamine oxidase A inhibitor and its metabolite, isorhamnetin, also inhibits. Total quercetin was the highest of the compounds in the sample diet. Although bioavailability was variable depending on the source, a healthy diet contains amounts of quercetin that might give sufficient amounts in brain to induce, by monoamine oxidase A inhibition, a small decrease in neurotransmitter breakdown.",

        "The naturally occurring b-carboline, harmane, has been implicated in various physiological and psychological conditions. Some of these effects are attributed to its interaction with monoaminergic systems. Previous literature indicates that certain b-carbolines including harmane modulate central monoamine levels partly through monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition. However, this is not always the case and thus additional mechanisms may be involved. This study set to assess the potential modulatory role of harmane on the basal or K(+) stimulated release of preloaded radiolabelled noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in rat brain cortex in vitro in the presence of the MAO inhibitor pargyline. Harmane displayed an overt elevation in K(+) -evoked [(3)H]5-HT release; whilst little and no effect was reported with [(3)H]DA and [(3)H]NA respectively. The effect of harmane on [(3)H]5-HT efflux was partially compensated in K(+)-free medium. Further analyses demonstrated that removal of Ca(2+) ions and addition of 1.2mM EGTA did not alter the action of harmane on [(3)H]5-HT release from rat brain cortex. The precise mechanism of action however remains unclear but is unlikely to reflect an involvement of MAO inhibition. The current finding aids our understanding on the modulatory action of harmane on monoamine levels and could potentially be of therapeutic use in psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety.",

        "Polysubstance use is common among individuals seeking treatment for substance use disorders (SUD). However, we know less about patterns and correlates of polysubstance use among treatment-seeking populations. The current study aimed to identify latent patterns of polysubstance use and associated risk factors in persons entering SUD treatment. Patients (N = 28,526) being admitted for substance use treatment reported on their use of thirteen substances (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, other stimulants, heroin, other opioids, benzodiazepines, inhalants, synthetics, hallucinogens, and club drugs) in the month before treatment and prior to the month before treatment. Latent class analysis (LCA) determined the relationship between class membership and gender, age, employment status, unstable housing, self-harm, overdose, past treatment, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Identified classes included: 1) Alcohol primary, 2) Moderate probability of past-month alcohol, cannabis, and/or opioid use; 3) Alcohol primary, Lifetime cannabis and cocaine use; 4) Opioid primary, Lifetime use of alcohol, cannabis, hallucinogens, club drugs, amphetamines, and cocaine; 5) Moderate probability of past-month alcohol, cannabis, and/or opioid use, Lifetime use of various substances; 6) Alcohol and cannabis primary, Lifetime use of various substances; and 7) High past-month polysubstance use. Individuals who engaged in past-month polysubstance use attended to face elevated risk of screening positive for recent unstable housing, unemployment, depression, anxiety, PTSD, self-harm, and overdose. Current polysubstance use is associated with significant clinical complexity. Tailored treatments that reduce harms resulting from polysubstance use and related psychiatric comorbidity may improve treatment outcomes in this population. ",

        "Human tissues express cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors that can be activated by endogenously released 'endocannabinoids' or exogenously administered compounds in a manner that reduces the symptoms or opposes the underlying causes of several disorders in need of effective therapy. Three medicines that activate cannabinoid CB(1)/CB(2) receptors are now in the clinic: Cesamet (nabilone), Marinol (dronabinol; D(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (D(9)-THC)) and Sativex (D(9)-THC with cannabidiol). These can be prescribed for the amelioration of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (Cesamet and Marinol), stimulation of appetite (Marinol) and symptomatic relief of cancer pain and/or management of neuropathic pain and spasticity in adults with multiple sclerosis (Sativex). This review mentions several possible additional therapeutic targets for cannabinoid receptor agonists. These include other kinds of pain, epilepsy, anxiety, depression, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, cancer, drug dependence, glaucoma, autoimmune uveitis, osteoporosis, sepsis, and hepatic, renal, intestinal and cardiovascular disorders. It also describes potential strategies for improving the efficacy and/or benefit-to-risk ratio of these agonists in the clinic. These are strategies that involve (i) targeting cannabinoid receptors located outside the blood-brain barrier, (ii) targeting cannabinoid receptors expressed by a particular tissue, (iii) targeting upregulated cannabinoid receptors, (iv) selectively targeting cannabinoid CB(2) receptors, and/or (v) adjunctive 'multi-targeting'.",

        "Scientific interest in the therapeutic effects of classical psychedelics has increased in the past two decades. The psychological effects of these substances outside the period of acute intoxication have not been fully characterized. This study aimed to: (1) quantify the effects of psilocybin, ayahuasca, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on psychological outcomes in the post-acute period; (2) test moderators of these effects; and (3) evaluate adverse effects and risk of bias. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies (single-group pre-post or randomized controlled trials) that involved administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD to clinical or non-clinical samples and assessed psychological outcomes 24 h post-administration. Effects were summarized by study design, timepoint, and outcome domain. A total of 34 studies (24 unique samples, n = 549, mean longest follow-up = 55.34 weeks) were included. Classical psychedelics showed significant within-group pre-post and between-group placebo-controlled effects on a range of outcomes including targeted symptoms within psychiatric samples, negative and positive affect-related measures, social outcomes, and existential/spiritual outcomes, with large between-group effect in these domains (Hedges' gs = 0.84 to 1.08). Moderator tests suggest some effects may be larger in clinical samples. Evidence of effects on big five personality traits and mindfulness was weak. There was no evidence of post-acute adverse effects. High risk of bias in several domains, heterogeneity across studies, and indications of publication bias for some models highlight the need for careful, large-scale, placebo-controlled randomized trials.

        "Psychedelics extracted from plants have been used in religious, spiritual, and mystic practices for millennia. In 1957, Dr. Hofmann identified and synthesized the prodrug psilocybin, a substance present in more than 200 species of psychedelic mushrooms. Although there were limitations related to the scientific design of many studies, clinical observations performed during the 1950s and 1960s showed a potential therapeutic effect of psilocybin for patients affected by depressive symptoms, anxiety, and conversion disorder. Psilocybin was classed as a schedule I substance in 1970, but the fascination with psychedelics has remained almost unchanged over time, promoting a new scientific interest starting in the 1990s. Recent studies have provided further evidence supporting the suggestive hypothesis of the therapeutic use of psilocybin for treating various psychiatric disorders, including pathological anxiety, mood depressive disorder, and addiction.",

        "Amid an international pandemic and a worsening mental health crisis, ketamine-assisted therapy is emerging as a promising solution for those deemed \"treatment resistant.\" Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are on the rise, with accelerating direct (e.g., burden of suffering) and indirect (e.g., disability/role impairment and impact on family) costs. Psychedelic-assisted therapies show significant promise in the treatment of a number of clinically challenging conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction, and end-of-life distress. Ketamine is currently the only safe, effective and legal widely available psychedelic-like medicine. To address the echo pandemic of health care provider distress, a multi-disciplinary team was charged with developing a ketamine-assisted psychotherapy program, delivered in a community of practice (CoP) group model and evaluated in a quality improvement framework. Program evaluation occurred through mixed methods. Quantitative mental health assessments included the PHQ-9 for depression, the PCL-5 for PTSD, GAD-7 for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and B-IPF for work/life functionality. Participant narrative feedback was collected to evaluate outcomes and for quality improvement purposes. Mean mental health scores were collected across three cohorts, totaling 94 patients. The mean aggregate scores of participants meeting the mental health assessment cut-off criteria (screening positive) were analyzed to assess clinical significance. Mean aggregate results comparing baseline vs. outcome measures (measured within 1-2 weeks after completion of the 12-week program) were clinically significant, demonstrating significant improvements in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and work/life functionality. In summary, 91% saw improvements in generalized anxiety, 79% saw improvements in depression, 86% of those who screened positive for PTSD now screen negative, and 92% had significant life/work functionality improvements. Qualitative feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with several unsolicited self-reports of transformation. Participant and team feedback enables the program to continue improving with each iteration. Results speak to the effectiveness of ketamine for psychedelic-assisted therapy, supported by a CoP framework. Outcomes are relevant for mental health programming, education and healthcare policy.",

        "In the last decade, a large number of studies using Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active principle derivative of the marijuana plant, or cannabinoid synthetic derivatives have substantially contributed to advance the understanding of the pharmacology and neurobiological mechanisms produced by cannabinoid receptor activation. Cannabis has been historically used to relieve some of the symptoms associated with central nervous system disorders. Nowadays, there are anecdotal evidences for the use of cannabis in many patients suffering from multiple sclerosis or chronic pain. Following the historical reports of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, recent research has highlighted the potential of cannabinoids to treat a wide variety of clinical disorders. Some of these disorders that are being investigated are pain, motor dysfunctions or psychiatric illness. On the other hand, cannabis abuse has been related to several psychiatric disorders such as dependence, anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, and psychosis. Considering that cannabis or cannabinoid pharmaceutical preparations may no longer be exclusively recreational drugs but may also present potential therapeutic uses, it has become of great interest to analyze the neurobiological and behavioral consequences of their administration. This review attempts to link current understanding of the basic neurobiology of the endocannabinoid system to novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention and its effects on the central nervous system.",

Its key role in synaptic transmission makes it a major drug target, e.g. for the treatment of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Here, we apply hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the conformational dynamics of human SERT in the absence and presence of known substrates and targeted drugs. Our results reveal significant changes in dynamics in regions TM1, EL3, EL4, and TM12 upon binding co-transported ions (Na/K) and ligand-mediated changes in TM1, EL3 and EL4 upon binding 5-HT, the drugs S-citalopram, cocaine and ibogaine. Our results provide a comprehensive direct view of the conformational response of SERT upon binding both biologically relevant substrate/ions and ligands of pharmaceutical interest, thus advancing our understanding of the structure-function relationship in SERT.

        "Whether the reported poorer mental health of ecstasy users is due to a bias in endorsement of somatic symptoms has been postulated, but rarely examined. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether levels of ecstasy use were associated with differential probabilities of endorsing somatic mental health symptoms. Current ecstasy users aged 24-30 years (n = 316) were identified from a population-based Australian study. Measures included frequency of ecstasy, meth/amphetamine, and cannabis use and the Goldberg anxiety/depression symptom scales. Multiple indicator, multiple cause models demonstrated no bias towards endorsing somatic symptoms with higher ecstasy use, both with and without adjustment for gender, cannabis, and meth/amphetamine use. Other studies using alternate measures of mental health should adopt this approach to determine if there is a bias in the endorsement of somatic symptoms among ecstasy users. ",

        "Preliminary evidence suggests that long-term ayahuasca use is associated with better psychosocial outcomes and less drug use; however, available data on the association between ayahuasca intake frequency and psychosocial outcomes is limited.  We sought to characterize and investigate the association of regular ayahuasca use, as compared to non-regular use, on licit (alcohol and tobacco) and illicit (cannabis, psychostimulants, psychedelics, and non-medical opioids) drug use and psychosocial outcomes.  An online-based cross-sectional survey was taken among people who use ayahuasca in Brazil assessing sociodemographic, drug and ayahuasca use, anxiety and depression (HAD-S), intrinsic religiosity (IRI), negative and positive affects (PANAS), satisfaction with life (SWLS), and five quality of life domains (WHOQOL-Brief). Multivariate regressions for each psychosocial outcome and drug use were performed comparing regular to non-regular ayahuasca users while correcting for sociodemographic variables.  A total of 286 valid answers were retrieved, divided into people with regular ( = 101) and non-regular ( = 185) ayahuasca use. Groups had similar sociodemographic profiles and lifetime use of drugs. In the multivariate analysis, regular use of ayahuasca was associated with lower anxiety (B: -0.97), negative affect (B: -2.62), general (B: 0.22) and physical (B: 0.17) quality of life, higher intrinsic religiosity scores (B: 4.16), and less past-month licit (OR = 0.30) and illicit (OR = 0.49) use of substances.  Our results show that ceremonial regular ayahuasca compared to non-regular use is associated with better psychosocial and mental health outcomes and less drug use. Studies with repeated ayahuasca administration and extended follow-ups are essential to clarify the nature of ayahuasca's therapeutic effects and to guide future clinical research. ",

        "Diseases that threaten life raise existential questions that can be a source of psychological distress. Studies with psychedelics demonstrate therapeutic effects for anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening illnesses. Ayahuasca has been proposed as a possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Preliminary studies suggest that ayahuasca could promote therapeutic effects for people with physical illnesses. The aim of this study was to explore how the ritual use of ayahuasca during the treatment of severe physical illnesses (SPI) may influence the way people understand and relate to their illness, using qualitative methods to assess the participants' perspectives. Participants who consumed ayahuasca ritualistically during the period of treatment for SPI were purposely chosen. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis was performed with 14 individuals. The ritual experience with ayahuasca acted on the participants' illness understanding through multiple psychological mechanisms, including introspection, self-analysis, emotional processing and catharsis, recall of autobiographical memories subjectively related to illness origin, illness resignification, and perspective changes. This study suggests that the experience with ayahuasca may facilitate illness acceptance through an influence on the meanings of the illness, life, and death. These changes may favor a more balanced relationship with illness and treatment.",

        "Depression and anxiety are psychiatric diagnoses commonly associated with low quality of life and low percentage of responsiveness by patients treated with currently available drugs. Thus, research into alternative compounds to treat these disorders is essential to guarantee a patient's remission. The last decade has witnessed a revamped interest for the application of psychedelic medicine for the treatment of mental disorders due to anecdotal reports and clinical studies which show that low doses of d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin may have antidepressant effects. LSD and psilocybin have demonstrated mood-modulating properties likely due to their capacity to modulate serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA) and glutamatergic systems. LSD, belonging to the category of \"classic halluginogens,\" interacts with the 5-HT system through 5HT, and 5HT receptors, with the DA system through D receptors, and indirectly also the glutamatergic neurotransmission thought the recruitment of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Randomized clinical studies have confirmed its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in humans. Thus, in this chapter, we will review the pharmacology of psychedelic drugs, report the most striking clinical evidence which substantiate the therapeutic potentials of these fascinating compounds in mood disorders, and look into the horizon of where psychedelic medicine is heading.

        "Depression and anxiety disorders are debilitating diseases resulting in substantial economic costs to society. Traditional antidepressants often take weeks to months to positively affect mood and are ineffective for about 30% of the population. Alternatives, such as ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic capable of producing hallucinations, and the psychoactive tisane ayahuasca, have shown great promise due to their fast-acting nature and effectiveness in treatment-resistant populations. Here, we investigate the effects of N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the principle hallucinogenic component of ayahuasca, in rodent behavioral assays relevant to anxiety and depression using adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats. We find that while DMT elicits initial anxiogenic responses in several of these paradigms, its long-lasting effects tend to reduce anxiety by facilitating the extinction of cued fear memory. Furthermore, DMT reduces immobility in the forced swim test, which is a characteristic behavioral response induced by many antidepressants. Our results demonstrate that DMT produces antidepressant and anxiolytic behavioral effects in rodents, warranting further investigation of ayahuasca and classical psychedelics as treatments for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",

        "Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance globally, with an estimated annual prevalence in 2010 of 2.6-5.0% of the adult population. Concerns have been expressed about increases in the potency of cannabis products. A high tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content can increase anxiety, depression, and psychotic symptoms, and can increase the risk of dependence and adverse effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems in regular users. The aim of this study was to report statistical data about the potency of cannabis products seized in the north-east of Italy, in a geographical area centred in Venice and extending for more than 10,000  km(2) with a population of more than two million, by investigating the variability observed in THC levels of about 4000 samples of cannabis products analyzed over the period 2010-2012. Overall median THC content showed an increasing trend over the study period from about 6.0% to 8.1% (6.2-8.9% for cannabis resin, 5.1-7.6% for herbal cannabis). The variation in the THC content of individual samples was very large, ranging from 0.3% to 31% for cannabis resin and from 0.1 to 19% for herbal cannabis. Median CBN:THC ratios showed a slightly decreasing trend over the study period, from 0.09 (2010) to 0.03 (2012), suggesting an increasing freshness of submitted materials. Median CBD:THC ratios also showed a decreasing trend over the study from about 0.52 (2010) to 0.18 (2012), likely due to the increase in submissions of materials from indoor and domestic cultivation with improved breeding methods.",

        "The long-term use of the serotonin-releaser and uptake-inhibitor 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\") has been associated with memory impairments and increased liability to depressive mood and anxiety attacks. It is unclear, however, whether these psychologic deviations are reflected in alterations of the underlying neurophysiologic substrate. The authors compared mood and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) profiles between regular polytoxic Ecstasy users and Ecstasy-naive controls. Brain activity as indexed by rCBF was measured during cognitive activation by an attentional task using positron emission tomography and [H2(15)O]. Mood was assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the EWL Mood Rating Scale. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that brain activity did not differ between the two groups. Both groups also performed equally on the cognitive task requiring sustained attention. However, significantly higher levels of depressiveness as determined by the HAM-D and EWL scales were found in Ecstasy-using subjects. These data indicate that, despite differences in mood, polytoxic Ecstasy users do not differ from Ecstasy-naive controls in terms of local brain activity. Heightened depressiveness in the Ecstasy group was consistent with results from previous studies and could be related to serotonergic hypofunction resulting from repeated MDMA consumption. However, this study cannot exclude the possibility that the observed differences are preexisting rather than a result of Ecstasy use.",

        "Several early phase studies have demonstrated that psilocybin-assisted therapy has rapid-acting and persisting antidepressant effects from just one or two doses. However, methodological limitations (e.g., placebo-control, blinding) limit interpretability of the existing literature. In an exploratory placebo-controlled, within-subject, fixed-order study, individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were administered placebo ( = 19) followed by psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) ( = 15) 4 weeks later. Dosing sessions were embedded within an manualized course of psychotherapy. Enhanced blinding procedures were used. Depression, anxiety, and quality of life were measured over a 16-week study period. Depression and anxiety significantly improved following both placebo and psilocybin with no significant difference in the degree of change between the two conditions. However, antidepressant effect sizes were larger after psilocybin (' = 1.02-2.27) than after placebo (' = 0.65-0.99) and there were high rates of response (66.7%) and remission (46.7%) following psilocybin administration. Antidepressant effects following psilocybin persisted, on average, for 2 months and there were persisting improvements in mood-related quality of life domains. The strength of mystical-type experience during psilocybin dosing was not correlated with subsequent antidepressant effects. The results of this exploratory study highlight the complex interplay between expectancy, therapy effects, and drug/placebo effects in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy studies. Nonetheless, the acute and persisting clinical improvements observed following psilocybin support further study of its potential in the treatment of major depression. Future studies should more explicitly mitigate and measure expectancy effects and assess the impact of repeated dosing and different forms of psychotherapeutic support. ",

        ": The high prevalence of alcohol/substance use among individuals with psychiatric disorders elucidates the import of investigations into associations between types and severity of psychiatric symptoms and alcohol/substance use. This study examined the likelihood of alcohol use disorder and substance use among individuals with varying depression and anxiety symptoms and severity thereof. Differences across sex were also examined. Using data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative sample from the United States ( = 43,093), separate logistic regressions estimated the odds of lifetime alcohol use disorder, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, and comorbid substance use across psychiatric symptom clusters controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity. Symptom severity was a more important correlate of alcohol use disorder and substance use than symptom type. In particular, the odds ratio of lifetime use of depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens, or any combination of these types of substances were higher for individuals with either severe depression or severe depression and anxiety relative to a healthy control. Moreover, the odds of having a diagnosis of lifetime alcohol use disorder were higher for individuals with severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and both depression and anxiety, relative to healthy individuals. Those with mild depression were more likely to engage in substance use than individuals with anxiety alone. Patterns of association among males and females were highly consistent. The findings highlight an enhanced risk of alcohol and substance use among individuals with severe depression and/or anxiety symptoms above what is seen among individuals with less severe symptomatology. In addition, this study shows a unique risk posed by the presence of depression on substance use. This study offers a framework for future studies to examine the causal mechanisms explaining the connection between psychiatric symptoms and alcohol/substance use. ",

        "The use of psychedelic treatments has shown very promising results in some psychiatric and addictive disorders, but not all patients achieved a response. The aim of this review is to explore the clinical and biological factors which could predict the response to psychedelics in psychiatric and addictive disorders. A systematic research was performed on MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Web of science, and Scopus databases from January 1990 to May 2020. All studies investigating the predictive factors of response to psychedelics regardless of psychiatric or addictive disorders, were included. Twenty studies investigating addictive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with life-threatening cancer were included in this review. We found that, in all indications, the main predictive factor of response to psychedelics is the intensity of the acute psychedelic experience. Indeed, we found this factor for alcohol and tobacco use disorders, treatment-resistant depression, and anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with life-threatening cancer, but not for obsessive-compulsive disorder. The intensity of the acute psychedelic experience was the main predicting factor of response. The action mechanism of this experience was not clear, but some hypotheses could be made, such as a modulation of serotoninergic system by 5-HT2A receptors agonism, a modulation of the default mode network (DMN) with an acute modular disintegration of the DMN followed by a re-integration of this network with a normal functioning, or an anti-inflammatory effect of this treatment.

        "Cannabis is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of negative affect. However, a paucity of research has examined the acute effects of cannabis on negative affect in everyday life. The current study provides a naturalistic account of perceived changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress as a function of dose and concentration of Dtetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Data from the app Strainprint (which provides medical cannabis users a means of tracking changes in symptoms as a function of different doses and chemotypes of cannabis) were analyzed using multilevel modeling. In total, 11,953 tracked sessions were analyzed (3,151 for depression, 5,085 for anxiety, and 3,717 for stress). Medical cannabis users perceived a 50% reduction in depression and a 58% reduction in anxiety and stress following cannabis use. Two puffs were sufficient to reduce ratings of depression and anxiety, while 10+ puffs produced the greatest perceived reductions in stress. High CBD (>9.5%)/low THC (<5.5%) cannabis was associated with the largest changes in depression ratings, while high CBD (>11%)/high THC (>26.5%) cannabis produced the largest perceived changes in stress. No changes in the perceived efficacy of cannabis were detected across time. However, baseline symptoms of depression (but not anxiety or stress) appeared to be exacerbated across time/tracked sessions. The primary limitations are the self-selected nature of the sample and the inability to control for expectancy effects. Cannabis reduces perceived symptoms of negative affect in the short-term, but continued use may exacerbate baseline symptoms of depression over time. ",

        "There is an increasing interest in combining psilocybin or methylenedioxymethamphetamine with psychological support in treating psychiatric disorders. Although there have been several recent systematic reviews, study and participant numbers have been limited, and the field is rapidly evolving with the publication of more studies. We therefore conducted a systematic review of PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and CINAHL for randomised controlled trials of methylenedioxymethamphetamine and psilocybin with either inactive or active controls. Outcomes were psychiatric symptoms measured by standardised, validated and internationally recognised instruments at least 2 weeks following drug administration, Quality was independently assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. There were eight studies on methylenedioxymethamphetamine and six on psilocybin. Diagnoses included post-traumatic stress disorder, long-standing/treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety in adults with autism, and anxiety or depression in life-threatening disease. The most information and strongest association was for the change in methylenedioxymethamphetamine scores compared to active controls in post-traumatic stress disorder ( = 4; standardised mean difference = -0.86; 95% confidence interval = [-1.23, -0.50];  < 0.0001). There were also small benefits for social anxiety in adults with autism. Psilocybin was superior to wait-list but not niacin (active control) in life-threatening disease anxiety or depression. It was equally as effective as escitalopram in long-standing depression for the primary study outcome and superior for most of the secondary outcomes in analyses uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Both agents were well tolerated in supervised trials. Trial quality varied with only small proportions of potential participants included in the randomised phase. Overall certainty of evidence was low or very low using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and psilocybin may show promise in highly selected populations when administered in closely supervised settings and with intensive support. ",

        "There is abundant evidence showing that repeated use of MDMA (3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) has been associated with depression, anxiety and deficits in learning and memory, suggesting detrimental effects on hippocampus. Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that has a neuromodulatory role in the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the role of A2a adenosine receptors agonist (CGS) and antagonist (SCH) on the body temperature, learning deficits, and hippocampal cell death induced by MDMA administration. In this study, 63 adult, male, Sprague - Dawley rats were subjected to MDMA (10 and 20 mg/kg) followed by intraperitoneal CGS (0.03 mg/kg) or SCH (0.03 mg/kg) injection. The animals were tested for spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) task performance, accompanied by a recording of body temperature, electron microscopy and stereological study. Our results showed that MDMA treatment increased body temperature significantly, and impaired the ability of rats to locate the hidden platform(P < 0.05). The number of hippocampal dark neurons also increased especially in CA1. These impairments were aggravated by co-administration of A2a antagonist (SCH) with MDMA. Furthermore, the administration of the A2a receptor agonist (CGS) provided partial protection against MWM deficits and hippocampal cell death(P < 0.05). This study provides for the first time evidence that, in contrast to A2a antagonist (SCH) effects, co-administration of A2a agonist (CGS) with MDMA can protect against MDMA hippocampal neurotoxic effects; providing a potential value in the prevention of learning deficits observed in MDMA users. However, the exact mechanism of these interactions requires further studies.",

        "The high and increasing prevalence of medical marijuana consumption in the general population invites the need for quality evidence regarding its safety and efficacy. Herein, we synthesize extant literature pertaining to the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) and its brain effects. The principle phytocannabinoid D-tetrahydrocannabinol (D-THC) and CBD are the major pharmacologically active cannabinoids. The effect of CBD on brain systems as well as on phenomenological measures (e.g. cognitive function) are distinct and in many cases opposite to that of D-THC. Cannabidiol is without euphoriant properties, and exerts antipsychotic, anxiolytic, anti-seizure, as well as anti-inflammatory properties. It is essential to parcellate phytocannabinoids into their constituent moieties as the most abundant cannabinoid have differential effects on physiologic systems in psychopathology measures. Disparate findings and reports related to effects of cannabis consumption reflect differential relative concentration of D-THC and CBD. Existing literature, notwithstanding its deficiencies, provides empirical support for the hypothesis that CBD may exert beneficial effects on brain effector systems/substrates subserving domain-based phenomenology. Interventional studies with purified CBD are warranted with a call to target-engagement proof-of-principle studies using the research domain criteria (RDoC) framework. ",

        "Cannabis varies considerably in levels of its two major constituent cannabinoids - (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Recently, we found evidence that those who smoked cannabis containing detectable levels of CBD had fewer psychotic-like symptoms than those whose cannabis had no CBD. The present study aimed, first, to replicate those findings and, second, to determine whether protective effects of CBD may extend to other harms of cannabis, such as memory impairment and reduced psychological well-being. A total of 120 current cannabis smokers, 66 daily users and 54 recreational users were classified into groups according to whether analysis of their hair revealed the presence or absence of CBD and high versus low levels of THC. All were assessed on measures of psychosis-like symptoms, memory (prose recall; source memory) and depression/anxiety. Lower psychosis-like symptoms were found in those whose hair had CBD compared with those without. However, this was seen only in recreational users, who had higher levels of THC in their hair. Higher THC levels in hair were associated with increased depression and anxiety. Prose recall and source memory were poorer in daily users with high THC levels in hair while recognition memory was better in individuals with CBD present in hair. CBD attenuates the psychotic-like effects of cannabis over time in recreational users. Higher THC negatively impacts on memory and psychological well-being. These findings raise concerns for the harms stemming from use of varieties such as 'skunk' (sensimillia), which lack any CBD but currently dominate the supply of cannabis in many countries. ",

        "Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins inhibit G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, including the signals that arise from neurotransmitter release. We have shown that RGS12 loss diminishes locomotor responses of C57BL/6J mice to dopamine transporter (DAT)-targeting psychostimulants. This diminution resulted from a brain region-specific upregulation of DAT expression and function in RGS12-null mice. This effect on DAT prompted us to investigate whether the serotonin transporter (SERT) exhibits similar alterations upon RGS12 loss in C57BL/6J mice. Does RGS12 loss affect (a) hyperlocomotion to the preferentially SERT-targeting psychostimulant 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), (b) SERT expression and function in relevant brain regions, and/or (c) serotonergically modulated behaviors? Open-field and spontaneous home-cage locomotor activities were quantified. 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and SERT levels in brain-region homogenates, as well as SERT expression and function in brain-region tissue preparations, were measured using appropriate biochemical assays. Serotonergically modulated behaviors were assessed using forced swim and tail suspension paradigms, elevated plus and elevated zero maze tests, and social interaction assays. RGS12-null mice displayed no hyperlocomotion to 10 mg/kg MDMA. There were brain region-specific alterations in SERT expression and function associated with RGS12 loss. Drug-naive RGS12-null mice displayed increases in both anxiety-like and anti-depressive-like behaviors. RGS12 is a critical modulator of serotonergic neurotransmission and serotonergically modulated behavior in mice; lack of hyperlocomotion to low dose MDMA in RGS12-null mice is related to an alteration of steady-state SERT expression and 5-HT uptake.

        "In view of the renewed interest in psychedelics in psychiatry it is timely to analyze psychedelic treatment in historical cohorts. Recently the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics has been linked to the so-called phenomenon of \"connectedness.\" The aim of the present study was to explore whether long-lasting personality changes were observed in any of the 151 Danish psychiatric patients who were treated with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) from 1960 to 1974.The exploration included a reanalysis of a subgroup as well from a 1964 Danish historical cohort. Medical records and other case materials of the above mentioned 151 patients are kept in the Danish State Archives. The present author was granted access to the LSD case materials in the Danish State Archives, and respected confidentiality per the Archives Law. According to the LSD Damages Law from 1986, they all received financial compensation for LSD-inflicted harm.Analysis did not reveal any personality changes such as \"connectedness;\" however, other lasting personality changes were observed in 2 to 4 patients and in quite a few patients unwanted effects persisted for weeks or months following acute treatment. In the present analysis of the 1964 cohort, the same percentage of patients improved with LSD treatment as in the historical analysis. In the latter, however, little attention was given to side effects, such as suicide attempts, suicides, and one homicide.Future psychedelic research with psychiatric patients should respect the potential toxicity of LSD and other psychedelics and meticulously monitor possible side effects.",

        "In self reports, abstinent ecstasy/polydrug users claim that they experience certain ongoing affective and psychological changes including elevated anxiety, arousal, and depression. In addition, various aspects of cognition (e.g., everyday memory, reasoning, executive functioning) appear to be affected. The present paper investigated the link between these two psychological sequelae. Ninety-five ecstasy/polydrug users completed tests of reasoning, intelligence, information processing speed, executive functioning, and everyday memory. Affect was measured via a mood adjective checklist. Adverse effects attributed to ecstasy were measured via responses to adjectives reflecting changes in users since they started using the drug. In addition, indicators of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were obtained. Users attributed a number of adverse effects to ecstasy, namely heightened irritability, depression, paranoia, and deteriorating health. Adverse effects were significantly and negatively correlated with aspects of intelligence, everyday memory, and sleep quality. Length of use of ecstasy use was positively correlated with adverse effects. While many users attribute a number of adverse affects to their use of ecstasy, it remains unclear whether these self-perceptions are a corollary of the psychopharmacological effects of the drug or reflect factors which in fact predate its use.",

        "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has agonist activity at various serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptors. Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, specific receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain unknown. We therefore conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over studyduring which 24 healthy human participants received either (i) placebo+placebo, (ii) placebo+LSD (100 ug po), or (iii) Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist,+LSD. We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared it to cortical gene expression maps. LSD reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory-somatomotor brain-wide and thalamic connectivity. Ketanserin fully blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. Whole-brain spatial patterns of LSD effects matched 5-HT2A receptor cortical gene expression in humans. Together, these results strongly implicate the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD's neuropharmacology. This study therefore pinpoints the critical role of 5-HT2A in LSD's mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational development of psychedelic-based therapeutics.

        "Among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), collinearity between polysubstance use and mental health concerns has obscured their combined effects on HIV risk with multivariable results often highlighting only one or the other. We used mediation and moderation analyses to examine the effects of polysubstance use and depressive symptoms on high-risk sex (i.e., condomless anal sex with serodiscordant/unknown status partner) in a sample of sexually-active GBM, aged >=16 years, recruited in Metro Vancouver using respondent driven sampling. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores assessed mental health. Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores assessed alcohol disorders. Poly-use of multiple drug types (e.g., stimulants, sedatives, opiates, hallucinogens) was assessed over the previous six months. Among 719 predominantly white (68.0%), gay-identified (80.7%) GBM, alcohol use was not associated with increased prevalence of high-risk sex. Controlling for demographic factors and partner number, an interaction between polysubstance use and depressive symptoms revealed that the combined effects were additively associated with increased odds for high-risk sex. Mediation models showed that polysubstance use partially mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and high-risk sex. An interaction effect between polysubstance use (defined by using 3 or more substances in the past six months) and depressive symptoms (defined by HADS scores) revealed that the combination of these factors was associated with increased risk for high-risk sex - supporting a syndemic understanding of the production of HIV risk.

        "Mood, sleep and pain problems are common comorbidities among treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent patients. There is limited evidence suggesting treatment for cannabis dependence is associated with their improvement. This study explored the impact of cannabis dependence treatment on these comorbidities. This is a secondary analysis from a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial testing the efficacy of a cannabis agonist (nabiximols) against placebo in reducing illicit cannabis use in 128 cannabis-dependent participants. Outcome measurements including DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress subscales); Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), were performed at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24. Each was analysed as continuous outcomes and as binary cases based on validated clinical cut-offs. Among those whose DASS and ISI scores were in the moderate to severe range at baseline, after controlling for cannabis use, there was a gradual decrease in severity of symptoms over the course of the trial. BPI decreased significantly until week 12 and then rose again in the post-treatment period during weeks 12-24. Neither pharmacotherapy type (nabiximols vs placebo) nor number of counselling sessions contributed significant explanatory power to any of the models and were excluded from the final analyses for both continuous and categorical outcomes. Participants in this trial who qualified as cases at baseline had elevated comorbidity symptoms. There was no evidence that nabiximols treatment is a barrier to achieving reductions in the comorbid symptoms examined. Cannabis dependence treatment reduced illicit cannabis use and improved comorbidity symptoms, even when complete abstinence was not achieved. ",

        "Stress develops when an organism requires additional metabolic resources to cope with demanding situations. This review will debate how recreational 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') can increase some aspects of acute and chronic stress in humans. Laboratory studies on the acute effects of MDMA on cortisol release and neurohormone levels in drug-free regular ecstasy/MDMA users have been reviewed, and the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in chronic changes in anxiety, stress, and cognitive coping is debated. In the laboratory, acute ecstasy/MDMA use can increase cortisol levels by 100-200%, whereas ecstasy/MDMA-using dance clubbers experience an 800% increase in cortisol levels, because of the combined effects of the stimulant drug and dancing. Three-month hair samples of abstinent users revealed cortisol levels 400% higher than those in controls. Chronic users show heightened cortisol release in stressful environments and deficits in complex neurocognitive tasks. Event-related evoked response potential studies show altered patterns of brain activation, suggestive of increased mental effort, during basic information processing. Chronic mood deficits include more daily stress and higher depression in susceptible individuals. We conclude that ecstasy/MDMA increases cortisol levels acutely and subchronically and that changes in the HPA axis may explain why recreational ecstasy/MDMA users show various aspects of neuropsychobiological stress.",

        "Mephedrone and methedrone are cathinone-related compounds, which act as non-selective substrates for monoamine transporters, facilitating a neurotransmitter release. We compared the acute pharmacological effects of mephedrone and methedrone, attempting to further evaluate the action mechanisms of methedrone by responsibly and ethically using mice under approved procedures. The effects of both compounds were examined from 10 to 60 min, in a series of behavioral paradigms, namely open-field, plus-maze, hot-plate and tail suspension tests, whereas neurotransmitter brain tissue levels were determined ex vivo by HPLC. Separate groups were pre-treated with the dopamine (DA) antagonist haloperidol, or the serotonin (5-HT) synthesis inhibitor rCPA, to further assess the mechanisms underlying methedrone effects. The compounds caused marked hyperlocomotion, displaying dissimilar stereotyped behavior, in an open-field arena. Mephedrone caused anxiolytic-like effects, while methedrone induced anxiogenic-like actions in the elevated plus-maze. Both compounds displayed thermal antinociception, with a reduced immobility time in the tail suspension model. Mephedrone triggered a 2- and 3-fold increment of dopamine and serotonin tissue levels, respectively, in the nucleus accumbens, with a 1.5-fold elevation of tissue dopamine in the frontal cortex. Methedrone caused a 2-fold increment of tissue dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and in the striatum, and a 1.5-fold increment of serotonin tissue levels in the hippocampus and striatum. In vivo methedrone effects were partially inhibited by a pre-treatment with haloperidol or rCPA. Despite similar actions on locomotion, analgesia, and depression-like behavior, the acute administration of mephedrone and methedrone elicited divergent effects on anxiety-like behavior and stereotyped movements in mice, which might be related to the distinct modulation of brain tissue neurotransmitter levels.",

        "The psychedelic effects of some plants and fungi have been known and deliberately exploited by humans for thousands of years. Fungi, particularly mushrooms, are the principal source of naturally occurring psychedelics. The mushroom extract, psilocybin has historically been used as a psychedelic agent for religious and spiritual ceremonies, as well as a therapeutic option for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelic use was largely associated with the \"hippie\" counterculture movement, which, in turn, resulted in a growing, and still lingering, negative stigmatization for psychedelics. As a result, in 1970, the U.S. government rescheduled psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs, ultimately ending scientific research on psychedelics. This prohibition on psychedelic drug research significantly delayed advances in medical knowledge on the therapeutic uses of agents such as psilocybin. A 2004 pilot study from the University of California, Los Angeles, exploring the potential of psilocybin treatment in patients with advanced-stage cancer managed to reignite interest and significantly renewed efforts in psilocybin research, heralding a new age in exploration for psychedelic therapy. Since then, significant advances have been made in characterizing the chemical properties of psilocybin as well as its therapeutic uses. This review will explore the potential of psilocybin in the treatment of neuropsychiatry-related conditions, examining recent advances as well as current research. This is not a systematic review.",

        "The recreational party drug \"ecstasy\" (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine MDMA) is particularly popular among young adults who are in the childbearing age and thus there is a substantial risk of prenatal MDMA exposure. We applied an intermittent treatment protocol with an early first injection on pregnant Wistar rats (15 mg/kg MDMA s.c. on the E4, E11 and E18 days of gestation) to examine the potential physiological, endocrine and behavioral effects on adult male and female offspring. Prenatal MDMA-treatment provoked reduced body weight of offspring from the birth as far as the adulthood. Adult MDMA-offspring had a reduced blood-glucose concentration and hematocrit, altered relative spleen and thymus weight, had lower performance on wire suspension test and on the first trial of rotarod test. In contrast, no alteration in the locomotor activity was found. Anxiety and depression related behavioral parameters in elevated plus maze, sucrose preference or forced swimming tests were normal. MDMA-offspring had elevated concentration of the ACTH-precursor proopiomelanocortin and male MDMA-offspring exhibited elevated blood corticosterone concentration. No significant alteration was detected in the serotonergic marker tryptophan-hydroxylase and the catcholaminergic marker tyrosine-hydroxylase immunoreactive fiber densities in MDMA-offspring. The mothers exhibited reduced densities of serotonergic but not catecholaminergic fibers after the MDMA treatment. Our findings suggest that an intermittent prenatal MDMA exposure with an early first injection and a relatively low cumulative dose provokes mild but significant alterations in physical-physiological parameters and reduces motor skill learning in adulthood. In contrast, these adult offspring do not produce anxiety or depression like behavior.",

        "The amygdala is a key structure in serotonergic emotion-processing circuits. In healthy volunteers, acute administration of the serotonin 1A/2A/2C receptor agonist psilocybin reduces neural responses to negative stimuli and induces mood changes toward positive states. However, it is little-known whether psilocybin reduces amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and whether any change in amygdala reactivity is related to mood change. This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin (.16 mg/kg) versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over design was used with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two separate sessions at least 14 days apart. Amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli was lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration. The psilocybin-induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state. These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers. These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression. ",

        "This review assesses the abuse potential of medically-administered psilocybin, following the structure of the 8 factors of the US Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Research suggests the potential safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress and substance use disorders, setting the occasion for this review. A more extensive assessment of abuse potential according to an 8-factor analysis would eventually be required to guide appropriate schedule placement. Psilocybin, like other 5-HT2A agonist classic psychedelics, has limited reinforcing effects, supporting marginal, transient non-human self-administration. Nonetheless, mushrooms with variable psilocybin content are used illicitly, with a few lifetime use occasions being normative among users. Potential harms include dangerous behavior in unprepared, unsupervised users, and exacerbation of mental illness in those with or predisposed to psychotic disorders. However, scope of use and associated harms are low compared to prototypical abused drugs, and the medical model addresses these concerns with dose control, patient screening, preparation and follow-up, and session supervision in a medical facility. CONCLUSIONS: (1) psilocybin has an abuse potential appropriate for CSA scheduling if approved as medicine; (2) psilocybin can provide therapeutic benefits that may support the development of an approvable New Drug Application (NDA) but further studies are required which this review describes; (3) adverse effects of medical psilocybin are manageable when administered according to risk management approaches; and (4) although further study is required, this review suggests that placement in Schedule IV may be appropriate if a psilocybin-containing medicine is approved.

        "This chapter begins with a brief review of descriptions and definitions of mystical-type experiences and the historical connection between classic hallucinogens and mystical experiences. The chapter then explores the empirical literature on experiences with classic hallucinogens in which claims about mystical or religious experiences have been made. A psychometrically validated questionnaire is described for the reliable measurement of mystical-type experiences occasioned by classic hallucinogens. Controlled laboratory studies show that under double-blind conditions that provide significant controls for expectancy bias, psilocybin can occasion complete mystical experiences in the majority of people studied. These effects are dose-dependent, specific to psilocybin compared to placebo or a psychoactive control substance, and have enduring impact on the moods, attitudes, and behaviors of participants as assessed by self-report of participants and ratings by community observers. Other studies suggest that enduring personal meaning in healthy volunteers and therapeutic outcomes in patients, including reduction and cessation of substance abuse behaviors and reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, are related to the occurrence of mystical experiences during drug sessions. The final sections of the chapter draw parallels in human neuroscience research between the neural bases of experiences with classic hallucinogens and the neural bases of meditative practices for which claims of mystical-type experience are sometimes made. From these parallels, a functional neural model of mystical experience is proposed, based on changes in the default mode network of the brain that have been observed after the administration of classic hallucinogens and during meditation practices for which mystical-type claims have been made.",

        "There has recently been a resurgence of interest in psychedelics, substances that profoundly alter perception and cognition and have recently demonstrated therapeutic efficacy to treat anxiety, depression, and addiction in the clinic. The receptor mechanisms that drive their molecular and behavioral effects involve activation of cortical serotonin 5-HT receptors, but the responses of specific cellular populations remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that a small subset of 5-HT-expressing excitatory neurons is directly activated by psychedelics and subsequently recruits other select cell types including subpopulations of inhibitory somatostatin and parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons, as well as astrocytes, to produce distinct and regional responses. To gather data regarding the response of specific neuronal populations, we developed methodology for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to segregate and enrich specific cellular subtypes in the brain. These methods allow for robust neuronal sorting based on cytoplasmic epitopes followed by downstream nucleic acid analysis, expanding the utility of FACS in neuroscience research. ",

        "There is a growing interest in the use of psychedelic substances for health related purposes, including symptom relief for disorders like anxiety, depression, and pain. Although the focus of recent clinical trials has been on high doses of these substances, anecdotal evidence suggests that low (micro) doses are also effective, and may be more suitable for certain conditions. Nonetheless, empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of microdosing with psychedelics for symptomatic relief is lacking. The present study aimed to investigate, by means of an online questionnaire, the self-rated effectiveness (SRE) of microdosing with psychedelics (MDP) for mental and physiological disorders compared to the conventional prescribed treatment and to regular doses of psychedelics.  An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora between March and July 2018. Respondents who had consented, were 18 years of age or older, had experience with microdosing and were diagnosed with at least one mental or physiological disorder by a medical doctor or therapist ( = 410; 7.2%) were included in the analyses. Odds ratio were calculated to compare the SRE of MDP with conventional treatment, and regular psychedelic doses for mental and physiological diagnoses for each of the three effectiveness questions (\"Did it work,\" \"Symptom disappear,\" \"Quality of life improved\").  Odds ratio showed that SRE of MDP was significantly higher compared to that of conventional treatments for both mental and physiological diagnoses; and that these effects were specific for ADHD/ADD and anxiety disorders. In contrast, SRE of MDP was lower compared to that of higher, regular psychedelic doses for mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, while for physiological disorders no difference was shown.  This study demonstrates that SRE of MDP to alleviate symptoms of a range of mental or physiological diagnoses is higher compared to conventionally offered treatment options, and lower than regular ('full') psychedelic doses. Future RCTs in patient populations should objectively assess the effectivity claims of psychedelics, and whether these are dose related, disorder specific, and superior to conventional treatments. ",

        "The monoamine theory of depression proposes that monoamine levels are lowered, but there is no explanation for how monoamine loss occurs. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is an enzyme that metabolizes monoamines, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. To determine whether MAO-A levels in the brain are elevated during untreated depression. Tertiary care psychiatric hospital. Seventeen healthy and 17 depressed individuals with major depressive disorder that met entry criteria were recruited from the care of general practitioners and psychiatrists. All study participants were otherwise healthy and nonsmoking. Depressed individuals had been medication free for at least 5 months. Harmine labeled with carbon 11, a radioligand selective for MAO-A and positron emission tomography, was used to measure MAO-A DVS (specific distribution volume), an index of MAO-A density, in different brain regions (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, caudate, putamen, thalamus, anterior temporal cortex, midbrain, hippocampus, and parahippocampus). The MAO-A DVS was highly significantly elevated in every brain region assessed (t test; P=.001 to 3x10(-7)). The MAO-A DVS was elevated on average by 34% (2 SDs) throughout the brain during major depression. The sizable magnitude of this finding and the absence of other compelling explanations for monoamine loss during major depressive episodes led to the conclusion that elevated MAO-A density is the primary monoamine-lowering process during major depression.

        "This study examined how psychedelics reduced symptoms of racial trauma among black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) subsequent to an experience of racism. A cross-sectional internet-based survey included questions about experiences with racism, mental health symptoms, and acute and enduring psychedelic effects. Changes in mental health were assessed by retrospective report of symptoms in the 30 days before and 30 days after an experience with psilocybin, Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), or 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). We recruited 313 diverse BIPOC in the US and Canada. Results revealed a significant ( < .001) and moderate (d = -.45) reduction in traumatic stress symptoms from before-to-after the psychedelic experience. Similarly, participants reported decreases in depression ( < .001; d = -.52), anxiety ( < .001; d = -.53), and stress ( < .001; d = -.32). There was also a significant relationship (R = 0.52,  < .001) between the dimension of acute psychedelic effects (mystical-type, insight, and challenging experiences) and decreases in a cluster of subsequent psychopathology (traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and stress), while controlling for the frequency of prior discrimination and the time since the psychedelic experience. BIPOC have been underrepresented in psychedelic studies. Psychedelics may decrease the negative impact of racial trauma. Future studies should examine the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy for individuals with a history of race-based trauma. ",

        "This article covers the renaissance of classical psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and LSD plus 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA-ecstasy) in psychiatric research. These drugs were used quite extensively before they became prohibited. This ban had little impact on recreational use, but effectively stopped research and clinical treatments, which up to that point had looked very promising in several areas of psychiatry. In the past decade a number of groups have been working to re-evaluate the utility of these substances in medicine. So far highly promising preliminary data have been produced with psilocybin in anxiety, depression, smoking, alcoholism, and with MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcoholism. These findings have led to the European Medicines Agency approving psilocybin for a phase 3 study in treatment-resistant depression and the Food and Drug Administration for PTSD with MDMA. Both trials should read out in 2020, and if the results are positive we are likely to see these medicines approved for clinical practice soon afterwards.\n\n.",

        "The mental health of youth is continually changing and requires reliable monitoring to ensure that adequate social and economic resources are allocated. This study assessed trends in mental health among Canadian youth, 12-24 years old. Specifically, we examined the prevalence of poor/fair perceived mental health, diagnosis of mood and anxiety disorders, suicidality, perceived stress and sleep problems, substance use, and mental health consultations. Data were collected from eight cycles of the annual Canadian Community Health Survey (2011-2018). Prevalence of mental health outcomes was calculated from each survey, and meta-regression was used to assess trends over time. In the absence of a significant trend over time, the eight cycles were pooled together using meta-analysis techniques to gain precision. Trends in prevalence were assessed for the overall sample of youth (12-24 years) and separately for male and female adolescents (12-18 years) and young adults (19-24 years). The prevalence of poor/fair perceived mental health, diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, and past-year mental health consultations increased from 2011 to 2018, most strongly among young adult females. Past-year suicidality increased among young adult females but did not change for other age and sex groups. Notably, the prevalence of binge drinking decreased by 2.4% per year for young adult males, 1.0% for young adult females and 0.7% per year for adolescent males, while staying relatively stable for adolescent females. Prevalence of cannabis use declined among adolescents before legalisation (2011-2017); however, this trend did not persist in 2018. Instead, the 2018 prevalence was 5.6% higher than the 2017 prevalence (16.3 v. 10.7%). The combined prevalence of other illicit drug use was stable at 4.6%; however, cocaine use and hallucinogens increased by approximately 0.2% per year. Our findings highlight a growing need for youth mental health services, as indicated by a rise in the prevalence of diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders and past-year mental health consultations. The reason for these observed increases is less apparent - it may represent a true rise in the prevalence of mental illness, or be an artefact of change in diagnostic practices, mental health literacy or diminishing stigma. Nonetheless, the findings indicate a need for the health care system to respond to the rising demand for mental health services among youth. ",

        "Cannabis is the most frequently used illegal substance in the United States and Europe. There is a dramatic increase in the demand for treatment for cannabis dependence. Cannabis users frequently have co-morbid mood symptoms, especially depression and anxiety, and regular cannabis users may self-medicate for such symptoms. We report a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment study, for the prevention of cannabis use in cannabis-dependent individuals. Regular cannabis-dependent users (n = 52) were treated for 9 weeks with weekly cognitive-behavior and motivation-enhancement therapy sessions together with escitalopram 10 mg/day. Urine samples were collected to monitor delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during treatment and questionnaires were administered to assess anxiety and depression. We observed a high rate of dropout (50%) during the 9-week treatment program. Fifty-two patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Of these, ten (19%) remained abstinent after 9 weeks of treatment as indicated by negative urine samples for THC. Escitalopram provided no advantage over placebo in either abstinence rates from cannabis or anxiety and depression scores during the withdrawal and abstinent periods. Escitalopram treatment does not provide an additional benefit either for achieving abstinence, or for the treatment of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Due to limitations of our study, namely, a high dropout rate and effects of low abstinence rates on measures of anxiety, depression and withdrawal, it is premature to conclude that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not effective for treatment of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome.

        "Marijuana is considered the most commonly used drug in the world, with estimated millions of users. There is dissent in the medical world about the positive and negative effects of marijuana, and recently, a large research effort has been directed to that domain. The main influencing drug ingredient is THC, which acts on the cannabinoid system and binds to the CB1 receptor. The discovery of the receptor led to the finding of an endogenous ligand, anandamide, and another receptor-CB2. The researchers also discovered that cannabinoids have extensive biological activity, and its short and long-term effects may cause cognitive and emotional deficiencies. Findings show that the short-term effects, such as shortterm memory and verbal Learning, are reversible. However, despite the accumulation of evidence about long-term cognitive damage due to cannabis use, it is difficult to find unequivocal results, arising from the existence of many variables such as large differences between cannabis users, frequency of use, dosage and endogenous brain compensation. Apart from cognitive damage, current studies investigate how marijuana affects mental illness: a high correlation between cannabis use and schizophrenia was found and a high risk to undergo a psychotic attack. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia who used cannabis showed a selective neuro-psychological disruption, and similar cognitive deficiencies and brain morphological changes were found among healthy cannabis users and schizophrenia patients. In contrast to the negative effects of marijuana including addiction, there are the medical uses: reducing pain, anxiety and nausea, increasing appetite and an anti-inflammatory activity. Medicalization of marijuana encourages frequent use, which may elevate depression.",

        "Long-term serotonin (5-HT) neuronal loss is currently a major cause of concern associated with recreational use of the substituted amphetamine 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; \"Ecstasy\"). Such loss may be problematic considering that psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety and responses to first line treatments for these disorders are associated with 5-HT. In this study the effects of prior exposure to MDMA on behavioural and central neurochemical changes induced by the serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitor and antidepressant fluoxetine were examined in rats. Animals were administered MDMA (10 mg/kg. i.p.) four times daily for two consecutive days. One week later the animals were subjected to treatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Fluoxetine treatment groups received either acute (saline injections for 20 days followed by 3 fluoxetine treatments over 24 h) or chronic (once daily fluoxetine for 21 days) drug administration. Prior exposure to MDMA resulted in an attenuation of fluoxetine-induced swimming behaviour in the modified forced swimming test (FST); a behavioural test of antidepressant action. In parallel MDMA treatment resulted in significant regional depletions of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) accompanied by a reduction in cortical [3H] paroxetine binding to nerve terminal 5-HT transporters. MDMA-induced 5-HT loss was enhanced in animals following chronic fluoxetine administration. Elimination of fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine from the brain abolished this interaction between MDMA and fluoxetine treatment. Fluoxetine administration reduced both 5-HIAA and the 5-HIAA:5-HT metabolism ratio, which was attenuated in animals pre-treated with MDMA. Overall the results show that MDMA induces long-term 5-HT loss in the rodent brain and consequently diminishes behaviour and reductions in 5-HT metabolism induced by the antidepressant fluoxetine. These results have potential clinical relevance, suggesting that 5-HT re-uptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine may be less effective at treating depression in chronic abusers of MDMA.",

        "Prior research has shown that acute subjective psychedelic effects are associated with both spontaneous and intended changes in depression and anxiety. Psychedelics are also theorized to produce increases in psychological flexibility, which could explain decreases in depression and anxiety following a psychedelic experience. Therefore, the present cross-sectional survey study sought to examine whether psychological flexibility mediated the relationship between acute psychedelic experiences and spontaneous or intended changes in depression and anxiety among a large international sample of people who reported having used a psychedelic (n=985; male=71.6%; Caucasian/white=84.1%;  =32.2, =12.6). A regression analysis showed that acute effects (i.e., mystical and insightful effects) were significantly associated with decreases in depression/anxiety following a psychedelic experience. A path analysis revealed that, while controlling for age and sex, increases in psychological flexibility fully mediated the effect of mystical and insightful experiences on decreases in depression and anxiety following a psychedelic experience. This suggests that psychological flexibility may be an important mediator of the therapeutic effects of psychedelic drugs. Future prospective experimental studies should examine the effect of psychedelic drug administration on psychological flexibility in order to gain a better understanding of the psychological processes that predict therapeutic effects of psychedelics.

        "The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT2 receptor subfamily consists of three members, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. These receptors share high homology in their amino acid sequence, have similar signaling pathways, and have been indicated to play important roles in feeding, anxiety, aggression, sexual behavior, mood, and pain. Subtype-selective agonists and antagonists have been explored as drugs for hypertension, Parkinson's disease, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and obesity. In this study, we report the development of homogeneous agonist binding assays in a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) format to determine the high-affinity binding state of agonist compounds for the human 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B receptors. The 5-HT2 agonist 1-(4- [125I]iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane ([125I]DOI) was used to label the high-affinity sites for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. The high-affinity sites for the 5-HT2B receptor were labeled with [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide. Total receptor expression was determined with the 5-HT2 antagonist [3H]mesulergine for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors, and [3H]ketanserin for the 5-HT2A receptor. The agonist high-affinity binding sites accounted for 2.3% (5-HT(2C) receptor), 4.0% (5-HT2A receptor), and 22% (5-HT2B receptor) of the total receptor population. Competition binding studies using known agonists indicated high Z' values of the agonist binding assays in SPA format (Z' > 0.70). The Ki values of 5-HT, (R)(-)DOI, and VER-3323 for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors by SPA format were equivalent to published data determined by filtration binding assays. These results indicate that agonist binding assays in SPA format can be easily adapted to a high throughput assay to screen for selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists, as well as for selectivity profiling of the compounds.",

        "Brain serotonin (5-HT) system has been implicated in pathophysiology of anxiety, depression, drug addiction, and schizophrenia. 5-HT2A receptor is involved in the mechanisms of stress-induced psychopathology and impulsive behavior. Here, we investigated the role of 5-HT2A receptor in the autoregulation of the brain 5-HT system. The chronic treatment with agonist of 5-HT2A receptor DOI (1.0 mg/kg, i.p./14 days) produced considerable decrease of 5-HT2A receptor-mediated \"head-twitches\" in AKR/J mice indicating desensitization of 5-HT2A receptors. Chronic DOI treatment failed to alter 5-HT2A receptor gene expression in the midbrain, hippocampus and frontal cortex. At the same time, the increase in the expression of the gene encoding key enzyme of 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the increase in TPH2 activity and 5-HT levels and decreased expression of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene was found in the midbrain of DOI-treated mice. The results provide new evidence of receptor-gene cross-talk in the brain 5-HT system and the implication of 5-HT2A receptor in the autoregulation of the brain 5-HT system.",

        "Recent and preprohibition studies show that patients with serious illness might benefit from psychedelic-assisted therapies for a range of symptoms, physical, psychosocial, and existential.  To explore the potential roles and research priorities of these therapies in patients with serious illness.  Qualitative study based on semistructured interviews with 17 experts in serious illness care and/or psychedelic research from the United States and Canada.  The interview guide elicited participants' perspectives on (1) the potential roles of psychedelic-assisted therapies in this setting, (2) research priorities relevant to this population, and (3) the potential for integrating psychedelic-assisted therapies into existing delivery models of serious illness care. We used thematic analysis until thematic saturation.  Domain I: Participants had polar views on the therapeutic potential of psychedelic-assisted therapies, ranging from strong beliefs in their medical utility to reluctance about their use in this patient population. They shared concerns related to the risks of adverse effects, such as delirium or worsening of psychological distress. Domain II: Research priorities primarily concerned patients with clinically diagnosed psychosocial distress, such as depression, anxiety, or demoralization. Participants also articulated potential roles extending beyond traditional medical diagnosis. Domain III: Participants emphasized essential safety and efficacy guidelines relevant to the integration of these therapies into existing models of care.  This qualitative study highlights issues and priorities for research on psychedelic-assisted therapies in patients with serious illness and proposes a conceptual framework for integrating these therapies into existing delivery models of serious illness care.

        "Thirty-three years ago, Gaddum and Picarelli classified the serotonin receptors in the guinea pig ileum into D and M types based on the activity of dibenzyline (D) and morphine (M) to block contractions of intestinal smooth muscle caused by serotonin. The subsequent location of specific ligand binding sites for serotonin in the brain has led to the identification of 14 serotonin receptor sub-types in rat brain. The cloning of these receptor sub-types has been of importance in enabling them to be classified as specific-protein molecules encoded by specific genes. The problem now arises with regard to the linking of the changes in the cellular activity of the various receptor sub-types with the plethora of behavioural changes that arise as a consequence of the actions of serotonin in the brain. The present review summarizes the evidence implicating the role of specific serotonin receptor sub-types in sleep, anxiety states, schizophrenia and depression. A summary of the relationship between these receptor sub-types and their possible involvement in the aetiology of schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders.",

        "Classical psychedelics are a group of drugs which act as agonists on the serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor. Evidence suggests they may have a uniquely rapid and enduring positive effect on mood. However, marked heterogeneity between methodological designs in this emerging field remains a significant concern. To determine how differences in the type of psychedelic agent used and the number of dosing sessions administered affect subjects' depression and anxiety outcomes and adverse drug reactions (ADR). This review collected and screened 1591 records from the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases for clinical trials reporting objective data on mood for subjects with a known anxiety or depression. After screening, nine clinical trials met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of these studies showed significant, large positive effect sizes for measures of anxiety (Cohen's  = 1.26) and depression (Cohen's  = 1.38) overall. These positive effects were also significant at acute (1 week) and extended (>1 week) time points. No significant differences were observed between trials using different psychedelic agents (psilocybin, ayahuasca or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)), however, a significant difference was observed in favour of trials with multiple dosing sessions. No serious ADR were reported. Psilocybin, ayahuasca and LSD all appear to be effective and relatively safe agents capable of producing rapid and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression. Moreover, the findings of the present analysis suggest that they may show a greater efficacy when given to patients over multiple sessions as compared to the more common single session used in many of the existing trials.

        "COMP360 is a proprietary, synthetic formulation of psilocybin being developed for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), a burdensome, life-threatening illness with high global impact. Here, we expand upon the previous report of primary outcomes from a phase 2 study of COMP360 in individuals with TRD-the largest randomised controlled clinical trial of psilocybin-to discuss findings of the exploratory efficacy endpoints. In this phase 2, double-blind trial, 233 participants with TRD were randomised to receive a single dose of psilocybin 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg (control), administered alongside psychological support from trained therapists. Efficacy measures assessed patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, positive and negative affect, functioning and associated disability, quality of life, and cognitive function. At Week 3, psilocybin 25 mg, compared with 1 mg, was associated with greater improvements from Baseline total scores in all measures. The 10 mg dose produced smaller effects across these measures. Interpretation of this trial is limited by the absence of an active comparator and the possibility of functional unblinding in participants who received a low dose of psilocybin. Three weeks after dosing, psilocybin 25 mg and, to a lesser degree, 10 mg improved measures of patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, affect, and functioning. These results extend the primary findings from the largest randomised clinical trial of psilocybin for TRD to examine other outcomes that are of importance to patients. ",

        "Prevalence of psychiatric disorders continues to rise globally, yet remission rates and patient outcome remain less than ideal. As a result, novel treatment approaches for these disorders are necessary to decrease societal economic burden, as well as increase individual functioning. The recent discovery of the endocannabinoid system has provided an outlet for further research into its role in psychiatric disorders, because efficacy of targeted treatments have been demonstrated in medical illnesses, including cancers, neuropathic pain, and multiple sclerosis. The present review will investigate the role of the endocannabinoid system in psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia, depressive, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorders, as well as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Controversy remains in prescribing medicinal cannabinoid treatments due to the fear of adverse effects. However, one must consider all potential limitations when determining the safety and tolerability of cannabinoid products, specifically cannabinoid content (ie, D-tetrahydrocannabinol vs cannabidiol) as well as study design. The potential efficacy of cannabinoid treatments in the psychiatric population is an emerging topic of interest that provides potential value going forward in medicine.",

        "5-Methoxy- N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychoactive compound found in several plants and in high concentrations in Bufo alvarius toad venom. Synthetic, toad, and plant-sourced 5-MeO-DMT are used for spiritual and recreational purposes and may have psychotherapeutic effects. However, the use of 5-MeO-DMT is not well understood. Therefore, we examined patterns of use, motivations for consumption, subjective effects, and potential benefits and consequences associated with 5-MeO-DMT use. Using internet-based advertisements, 515 respondents ( M=35.4. SD=11.7; male=79%; White/Caucasian=86%; United States resident=42%) completed a web-based survey. Most respondents consumed 5-MeO-DMT infrequently (<once/year), for spiritual exploration, and had used less than four times in their lifetime. The majority (average of 90%) reported moderate-to-strong mystical-type experiences ( M=3.64, SD=1.11; range 0-5; e.g., ineffability, timelessness, awe/amazement, experience of pure being/awareness), and relatively fewer (average of 37%) experienced very slight challenging experiences ( M=0.95, SD=0.91; range 0-5; e.g., anxiousness, fear). Less than half (39%) reported repeated consumption during the same session, and very few reported drug craving/desire (8%), or legal (1%), medical (1%), or psychiatric (1%) problems related to use. Furthermore, of those who reported being diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, the majority reported improvements in symptoms following 5-MeO-DMT use, including improvements related to post-traumatic stress disorder (79%), depression (77%), anxiety (69%), and alcoholism (66%) or drug use disorder (60%). Findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT is used infrequently, predominantly for spiritual exploration, has low potential for addiction, and might have psychotherapeutic effects. Future research should examine the safety and pharmacokinetics of 5-MeO-DMT administration in humans using rigorous experimental designs. ",
